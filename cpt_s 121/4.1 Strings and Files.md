## Global vs. local variables

Global variables are accessible everywhere, but can cause problems.

Local variables are only accessible within their respective scopes. This type of compartmentalisation is good.

### Example

```c
#include <stdio.h>

double x = 0;

void show_x(void);

int main(void) {
  double x = 5;
  
  printf("main: x = %g\n", x);
  show_x();
  
  return 0;
}

void show_x(void) {
  printf("show_x: x = %g\n", x);
}
```

#### Output

```
main: 5
show_x: 0
```

## Files

> Files help with creating, reading, updating, and deleting data

C views each file as a sequential *stream* of bytes
End of file is indicated with an end-of-file marker (`EOF`)

When a program starts execution, three streams

### Manipulating files

1. Open the desired file
	- Based on filename and mode (read, write, or append)
	- Creates a new stream
2. Process the file
	- Read data from file ("r" mode)
		- Does not affect file
	- Write data to file ("w" mode)
		- Erases old file if one existed
		- Replaces contents with new data
	- Append data to file ("a" mode)
		- Only writes new data to file
		- Does not affect previous data

### Opening a file

Prototypes defined in `<stdio.h>`

Open a file:
- `fopen()` returns a "file handle" (`FILE *`) to opened file

Read from a file:
- `fscanf()`
- `fscanf(stdin, ...)` = `scanf`

Write to a file:
- `fprintf()`
- `fprintf(stdout, ...)` = `printf`

Close a file:
- `fclose()` closes the stream

## More on strings

`char`: stores a single character
`char *`: stores a string, terminated by the null character `'\n'`
`char[n]`: stores a string of length $n - 1$ - the final character is the null character

## File preprocessors

```c
#define __DEBUG__

#ifdef __DEBUG__
printf("This code will be compiled only if __DEBUG__ is defined.\n")
#endif
```
