> The process in which a function calls itself either directly or indirectly through another function.
> The function that is called is known as a *recursive* function.

### Example

```c
int fibonacci(int n) {
	if (n <= 1) return 1; // simple/base case
	return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); // recursive step
}
```
