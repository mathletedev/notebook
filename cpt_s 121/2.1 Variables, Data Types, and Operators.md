> *Data Type*
> A representation of information and values and the corresponding operations that you can apply

Memory are like storage boxes that allow you to "remember" information for later use

`main.c`
`main`: name of file
`.c`: extension type (to determine compiler used)

A `#` symbol declares a *preprocessor directive*
- These are examined before compilation

**Integer division**: when dividing integers, the result gets truncated (i.e. 70.8 becomes 70)

## Arithmetic operators

| Operator | Representation | Example |
| -------- | -------------- | ------- |
| + | Addition | 10 + 5 = 15 |
| - | Subtraction | 10.7 - 5.2 = 5.5 |
| * | Multiplication | 2 * 4 = 8 |
| / | Division | 2 / 3 = 0 |
| % | Modulus | 5 % 2 = 1 |

## Printing floating-point numbers

When `printf()`-ing a double `x`, use `printf("%lf", x)`
To round to `n` decimal places, use `printf("%.nlf", x)`

## Type casting

To turn an `int` into a `double`, use `(double)x`
