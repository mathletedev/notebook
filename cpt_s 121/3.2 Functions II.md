## Characters

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): standardised table that assigns a number to every character

```c
char c = 'a'
```

### Strings

By utilising pointers, strings of characters can be stored in a variable

```c
char *s = "Hello, world!";
```

The end of a string is marked by the `null` character: `\0`
