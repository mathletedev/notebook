## Bubble sort

Iterate over array `n - 1` times, swapping adjacent elements if first element is greater than second element.

## Strings

Literal string: `"abc"`: cannot modify -> `printf("abc");`

### Ways to initialise

- `char my_string[100] = {'a', 'b', 'c', '\0'};`
- `char my_string[100] = "abc";`
- `char *my_string = "abc";` <- This is *immutable* (can't be modified)

`my_string` is the **address** of the first character of a string.

### Reading

1. `scanf("%s", my_string);`
	- Note: if the input is longer than size of `my_string`, the end of the array will not be `\0` and the program will crash

2. `fgets(my_string, 100, stdin);`
	- Safer way to read strings
	- Reads up to `100 - 1` characters to leave room for null character

### `strings.h` library

- `strcpy(dest, src);`: copies `src` to `dest`
	- Note: possible crash if `src` is larger than `dest`

- `strncpy(dest, src, 10);` copies 10 characters of `src` to `dest`
	- Note: leave 1 extra character for null character
