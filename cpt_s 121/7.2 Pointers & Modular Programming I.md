-> [Lecture code](https://github.com/mathletedev/cpt_s/blob/main/121/lectures/2023-10-04)

Function parameters are copied, so any modification to a variable inside of a function will not affect the variable outside of the function.

```c
int main() {
	int num = 4;
	num = f(num);
}

int f(int n) {
	++n; // does nothing
}
```

## Pointers

> A *pointer* is a variable that stores the *address* of another variable

```mermaid
flowchart LR

A(ptr\nValue: $200\nAddress: $100) -->|points to| B(num\nValue: 4\nAddress: $200)
```

`&`: address operator / reference declarator
`*`: indirect value operator / pointer declarator

**dangling pointer**: A pointer that points to a deallocated variable
