```c
char c = 'A';
```

`c` is represented by ASCII code `65`.
$65 - 2^6 = 1$
$1 - 2^0 = 0$
Thus, `c` can be represented by the binary number `0b01000001`.

```c
char c = 0b010000001;
```

```c
int a; // max: 2147483647 min: -2147483648
unsigned int b; // max: 4294967295 min: 0
```

The first bit of `b` is a **signed bit** (0 for positive, 1 for negative).

## Bitwise operators

### `&` (binary) bitwise **AND**

| A   | B   | R   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |
| 1   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

```
  0101
& 1100
------
  0100
```

- clear bits
- check bits

### `|` (binary) bitwise **OR**

| A   | B   | R   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 1   |

- set bits

### `^` (binary) bitwise **XOR**

| A   | B   | R   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |

- controlled negation

### `~` (unary) bitwise **NEGATION**

```
~00001101 = 11110010
```

### `<<` (binary) bitwise **LEFT SHIFT**

```
00001010 << 1 = 00010100
```

### `>>` (binary) bitwise **RIGHT SHIFT**
