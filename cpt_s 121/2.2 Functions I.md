## Top-down design

- Manages complex problems by decomposing into less-complex sub-problems
- Divide and conquer
- By solving each sub-problem and combining the solutions, the greater problem is solved
- Easy to test sub-problems

## Returning values

- `return` keyword
- Assignment to an address

### Example

```c
double f(double x) {
	return x * x - 4 * x + 4;
}
```

## Advantages of functions

- Break a large, complex solution into logical units
- Procedural abstraction
- Reusable code (no duplicate code)
