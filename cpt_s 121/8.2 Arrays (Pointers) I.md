## What is an array?

> - A sequence of items that are contiguously allocated in memory
> - All items in the array are of the same data type and the same size
> - All items are accessed by the same name, but a different index

### Example

| Index | 0    | 1    | 2    | 3    |
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| ID    | 3829 | 4822 | 8247 | 1820 |

-> An array is a data structure

> A data structure is a way of storing and organising data in memory so that it may be accessed and manipulated efficiently
