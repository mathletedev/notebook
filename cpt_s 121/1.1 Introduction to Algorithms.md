> A sequence of instructions that solve a problem

- A well ordered collection...
- Of unambiguous and effectively computable operations...
- That produces a result...
- And halts in a finite amount of time.

## Types of instructions

- Sequenced instructions
	- do them in the order given
- Conditional instructions
	- do them if a condition is true
- Iterative instructions
	- do them while a condition is true
