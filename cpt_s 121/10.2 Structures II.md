## String manipulation

- `strcpy()` replaces the assignment operator
- `strcat()` replaces the + or append operator
- `strcmp()` replaces relational operators

---

- `strtok(my_string, ",");`: finds the next occurrence of `,` and replaces it with `\0`
- `strtok(NULL, ",");`: starts from the previous address

## Structs

> Combine multiple variables into a single "package" (also known as *encapsulation*).
> Sometimes referred to as an *aggregate*, where all variables are under one name.

```c
struct StudentRecord {
	int id;
	char last_name[30];
	char first_name[30];
	double gpa;
};

struct StudentRecord student;
```

### Typedef

```c
typedef struct StudentRecord {
	int id;
	char last_name[30];
	char first_name[30];
	double gpa;
} StudentRecord;

StudentRecord student;
```


## Memset

Defined in `strings.h`

- `memset(my_array[0], -1, 10);`: sets 10 values (starting from the address of `my_array[0]`) to `-1`
