## Compilers

Compilers differ from interpreters in that compilers are **off-line** (as opposed to on-line).

I.e.:
- Interpreters are given **program** and **data** to provide outputs
- Compilers are given **programs** to provide executables; Executables are given **data** to provide outputs


**Speedcoding**: Similar to an interpreter; problem was, used a lot of memory

Steps:
1. Lexical Analysis
   - Understanding structure
2. Parsing
3. Semantic Analysis
   - Understanding meaning
4. Optimisation
5. Code Generation
   - Modifies programs to run faster, use less memory, etc.

## Economy

> *Programmer training* is the dominant cost for a programming language.

- Widely-used languages are slow to change
- Young languages are easy to change
- Each language has a unique use case
- New languages tend to look like old languages (reduces training cost)
