# Long Term

## Absolutism not flexible
French like English constitutional ideas, where people have equal rights

## Unsystematic form of tax collection
Hundreds of tax collectors, can collect as much as they want, very unfair

## American Revolution
America has the Constitution and Bill of Rights
Proves Enlightenment ideas *can* be implemented
Why would the French government support something that they themselves don't have?

## [[Marie Antoinette]]

## Old regime tax system
[[First Estate]]: 0.5% of population, 15% of land
[[Second Estate]]: 1.5% of population, 20% of land
[[Third Estate]]: 97-98% of population, 40% of land
"No land without lord"

## Enlightenment Ideas

## Bread
Dark bread - can put anything in the flour, such as dirt, to make it cheaper
1788: 50% of peasants' income spent on bread
1789 (start of Revolution): 80% of income
Cost of living growing faster than wages

Price of wheat up 66%
Rye 71%
Wood 91%

## High unemployment
50% in Paris
