## Types of Binary Tree Traversals

- **Depth-First Traversal** (DFS)
    - In-order
    - Pre-order
    - Post-order
- **Breadth-First Traversal** (BFS)
    - Also known as **level-order traversal**

## AVL Complexity

Insertion: $O(\log n)$
Balance: $O(\log n)$
Rotation: $O(1)$
Deletion: $O(\log n)$
