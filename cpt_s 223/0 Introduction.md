**Data Structures**: Strategies for arranging things in memory based on the type of operations we want to perform.
**Containers**: Tangible implementation which allows us to store **collections** as per the selected strategy.

## What We Will Learn

- Different strategies for *arranging* collections in the computer's memory, based on the *intended* operations.
- *Pros and cons* of different strategies and how to compare them.
- *Breaking down a problem* in a way to identify the memory organisation strategy (data structure) that helps us solve it efficiently.
- How to *implement/utilise containers* that follow said strategies.
- *Algorithms* that go hand-in-hand with these data structures.
- Ways to *analyse* data structures and algorithms.
