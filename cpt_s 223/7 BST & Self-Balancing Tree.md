**Efficiency**: $O(H)$ where $H$ is the height of the tree.

Different implementations of a self-balancing tree:
1. AVL Trees
2. Splay Trees
3. Red-Black Trees

## Binary Search Trees

- Each node has at most two children
- All nodes in the left subtree are lesser than any node in the right subtree.

## AVL Trees

New property: For every node, the *height difference* between its left and right subtrees is at most one.
