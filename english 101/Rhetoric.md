> The available arts and means of persuasion

## Background

Ancient Greco-Roman Tradition or Classics
Rhetoric has been used for *oration*
- Homer's work (such as the Odyssey) was passed down through speech

Rhetoric is **not** arbitrary

## Appeals

- Ethos: appeal to *credibility*
- Pathos: appeal to *emotion*
- Logos: appeal to *logic*
- Kairos: appeal to *time*
- [[Memoria]]: appeal to *memory*

-> Commonly used in political debates

You are never using just one appeal

## Rhetorical approach

1. Role of the writer
2. Role of the audience
3. Text/message we create
4. Medium
	- How the text is embodied (textbook, newspaper, social media post, poster)
