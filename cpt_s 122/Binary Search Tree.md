**root**: The starting node of the tree
**leaf**: A node with no children
**edge**: A connection between 2 nodes
**depth**: Number of edges from root to node
**height**: Number of edges from a given leaf to the node in the *longest path*

- Note: the depth of a tree and the height of a tree are always the same
