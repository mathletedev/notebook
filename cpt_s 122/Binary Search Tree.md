Properties:
- Rooted tree
- Each node has at most 2 children
- For every given node, the left sub-tree should contain values less than the root o the sub-tree, and the right sub-tree should contain values greater than the root of the sub-tree

**root**: The starting node of the tree
**leaf**: A node with no children
**edge**: A connection between 2 nodes
**depth**: Number of edges from root to node
**height**: Number of edges from a given leaf to the node in the *longest path*

- Note: the depth of a tree and the height of a tree are always the same

## In-order traversal

1. Go left
2. Process current node
3. Go right
