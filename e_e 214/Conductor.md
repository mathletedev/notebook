**Conductor**: Regular structure with free charge.
**Semiconductor**: Somewhere in the middle.

Silicon is a semiconductor. By replacing ~0.1 PPM with another material (such as phosphorus), we can vastly change the properties of silicon.

If `Vdd` is on the top and $> 0.7V$, current flows (and really fast).
If `Vdd` is on the bottom, opposites attract, so no current flows.
This is called a **diode**. The symbol shows the direction of current.

An **LED** is a light-emitting diode.
