**Rails**: The main wires that transport power
**Ground (GND)**: The lowest voltage point in a circuit, used for reference
**Vdd**: The highest voltage point in a circuit

[[Voltage#Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]]: $V = I \cdot R$
[[Power]] (W): $P = V \cdot I$

**Open circuit**: When the path of the circuit is broken
**Short circuit**: When there is no load on a circuit

**Signal**: A method of communicating information
