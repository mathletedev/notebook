**Rails**: The main wires that transport power
**Ground (GND)**: The lowest voltage point in a circuit, used for reference
**Vdd**: The highest voltage point in a circuit

[[Voltage#Ohm's Law|Ohm's Law]]: $V = I \cdot R$
[[Power]] (W): $P = V \cdot I$

**Open circuit**: When the path of the circuit is broken
**Short circuit**: When there is no load on a circuit

**Signal**: A method of communicating information

## Batteries

AA battery: $1.5V$
Lithium battery: $3.6V$
Smoke detector battery: $9V$
Car battery: $12V$

## The Human Diagram

A human body is similar to a $200 \ohm$ resistor. $10 \micro A$ through the SA node is enough to cause arrhythmia.

Capacitors store charge until it is dissipated.

We all have some capacitance relative to earth ground.
