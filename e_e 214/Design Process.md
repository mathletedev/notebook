1. Objectify
  - Conceive of what a circuit will look like
2. Formalism
  - Make the requirements clear
  - E.g. truth tables - show exactly what is needed
3. Shorten
  - See if there's a way to minimise the circuit
4. Validation
  - Simulate signals coming out are expected from signals going in
  - Implement a physical, interactive model that leaves no room for assumptions
