## The Modern State

- Extensive bureaucracies:
  - civil servants
  - hired based (partially) on competence and expertise
  - paid a salary
  - given specific spheres of authority
  - bound by complex rules
- Capacity to tax and regulate economic activity
- Capacity to regular large sphere of social life
- Claim to govern a population with a shared social identity - nations and nation-states

## The Novelty of the Modern State

- For most of human history, no states existed
- When states emerged comparatively recently, they were *patrimonial, not bureaucratic*
- The modern, bureaucratic nation-state is a relatively recent innovation, dating approximately back to the French Revolution

## The Non-Ubiquity of the Modern, Bureaucratic Nation-State

- Contemporary states all claim to be modern, bureaucratic nation-states, but many states conform to this model only minimally

## States

1. States are organisations whose control over military, political, economic, and ideological resources allows them to claim ultimate authority; to issue commands binding on all other social organisations and groups.
2. Modern states exercise authority through expansive and permanent bureaucracies and claim to represent the nation.
3. Prior to the modern era, states exercised patrimonial authority - rulers claimed ownership of the state as an extension of their household - over culturally heterogeneous societies that had no sense of common identity, few shared institutions, and many locally powerful intermediaries between rulers and the ruled.

## Some Questions

1. What are the initial origins of the state?
2. Why were pre-modern states patrimonial?
3. What caused the transition to the modern nation-state? And why has that transition been uneven around the contemporary world?
4. What are the implications of the modern state for other important questions such as the origins of democracy or the causes of modern capitalist economies?

## Two Visions of the State

- As providers of goods and services valuable to society, especially protection of property.
- As exploiters of society through predation.

Most states, in fact, are a mixture of protection and predation; the balance can shift over time and has very large consequences.

## Pre-Neolithic Revolution

- States do not exist either to provide protection or to be predatory on society.
- For a state to exist, there must be economic surplus.
- In hunter-gatherer societies, there is no economic surplus, and everybody more or less has the same factor endowment.
- Therefore, for states to exist, there must have been a prior shift in the distribution of factor endowments.

## Neolithic Revolution in the Zagros Mountains

- Climactic changes stimulate technological innovations and revolutionary shift from hunter-gathering in very small communities to semi-settled agriculture that could sustain greater populations
- First five to seven thousand years: No permanent settlements or autonomous political institutions

## Urban Revolution Where the Tigris Meets the Euphrates

- Fortifications, property deeds, and legal codes
- Priestly class and scribes
- But no autonomous political institutions
  - Governance through pre-existing religious and kinship institutions

## Imperial Revolution: Sargon the Conqueror

- Conquers many states, combined into one
- Sargon did **NOT** invent the modern state
- Expansive scope of power

## Institutional Innovation and the First State

The first set of explicitly political institutions claiming priority over all other economic, religious, and family-based institutions, with no function other than to rule a territory and its population.
- taxation
- permanent (but very small) bureaucracy
- specialists in coercion/cultural change
- standardised systems of weights and measures
- creation of imperial culture binding elites across the empire through written records and uniform education

## From Conquest to Administration

- How did Sargon administer his empire?
- How does the **logic of conquest** differ from the **logic of administration**?

The basic problem of rule discovered by Sargon:
> The radius of conquest is larger than the radius of administration

## Patrimonialism

- Pre-modern rulers relied on traditions of paternal authority and extended family links to justify their control over kin and unrelated retainers
- Just as a patriarch could duplicate and transfer his authority to sons, so too could a pre-modern rule grant benefices to loyal followers, allowing them to claim authority
- But once granted such authority, agents of the ruler became quasi-autonomous local rulers and were difficult to control

**Who watches the watchman?**

**Fallacy of the Minion**: All villains have minions who serve their master faithfully and fully

People will naturally do what they want in the absence of authority.

## Principal-Agent Relations and the Fallacy of the Minion

- Because people have limited time, energy, resources, talents, skills, and specialised training, we ask others to perform tasks on our behalf, and act called delegation.
- The **principal** in any relationship, is the person or persons (or organisations) in whom authority originally resides.
- The **agent** is another person to whom the principal delegates his or her authority, authorising the agent to act in his/her behalf.

## Agency Loss or the Loss of Delegated Power

- **Agency loss** is the difference between the *optimal* outcome of delegation, when the agent does exactly as the principal desires, and the *actual* consequence of delegation, when the agent may take actions that are not consistent with the outcomes desired by the principal.
- When there is agency loss, the agent is doing something contrary to the wishes of the principal (including doing nothing: indolence or "slack" is a type of agency loss)
- Rulers, including mighty emperors, issue proclamations: They cannot personally execute those proclamations

## Two Conditions Generating Agency Loss

1. Interest alignment: How much divergence exists between the interests of the agent and the interests of the principal? If they both want the same thing, there can be no agency loss.
2. Information: How knowledgeable is the principal about the agent's action? If the agent cheats, will the principal know about it? This is the problem of **asymmetric information**.
  - The agent should have complete information; He/she knows what he/she has done
  - The principal has only incomplete information

> "The potential for mischief varies inversely with one's proximity to the authority figure."

## Two Types of Power (and Ergo Ways to Minimise Agency Loss)

- Despotic power refers to the ruler's (or state's) ability to make decisions without consulting either subsidiary political elites or non-state actors.
  - The despot makes decisions unilaterally, but implementation requires delegation to agents and is therefore potentially undermined by agency loss
  - Despotic states may be infrastructurally weak.
- Infrastructural power refers to the capacity of the ruler (state) to implement its decisions, elicit compliance from its population, and therefore achieve its objectives.

**Despotic power**: King can make decisions with little consultation. Non-despotic e.g. there are many feudal landlords who can challenge the king.

Despotic power can be lowered through electoral systems -> accountability and representation

Sargon captured city-states but kept the authorities (under his own command). Adapted local power structures to his own needs.

Did not usually disrupt local institutions. Instead, as long as local system of rule provided some tax, it was cost effective.

## Four Strategies of Imperial Rule

1. Direct rule by emperor's military forces and bureaucrats: Cannot do this everywhere!
2. Ideological conversion: Create agents that identify with ruler through culture and education.
3. Provide public goods: Induce compliance through better services (win hearts and minds).
4. Rule indirectly through local power structures.

## Why Not Rule Through a Bureaucracy?

- Relatively primitive agrarian economies with limited trade will not support a class of salaried bureaucrats
- Relatively primitive transportation and communication will not allow bureaucrats to cover extensive territory
- Relatively primitive techniques for recording and storing technology

*Takeaway: limited by technology*

## Pre-Modern States

- In virtually all pre-modern polities:
  - Rulers, no matter how powerful, ruled indirectly, usually relying on local elites, supplementing them at times with elements of the army or directly appointed rules
