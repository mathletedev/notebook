Why so important?
- The most - or at the very least one of the clearest - indicators of a democracy
- The bare minimum

Electoral system
- A system of rules that outline how elections will be conducted
- Three main types:
  - Majoritarian
  - Proportional
  - Mixed
- In reality, a great deal of variation
- Be aware of what kinds of incentives electoral systems generate

Accountability
- Holding politicians, political parties, and governments accountable
  - I.e. how to punish/reward at the next election (reelection)

Representation
- To what extent the government/parliament/etc. most fairly and accurately represents a wide variety of people and opinions

## Majoritarian Electoral Systems

- Seats in legislature allocated by territorial-based districts or constituencies
- Whoever receives the most votes wins
  - Majority systems
  - Plurality systems
  - Even with < 50% of the votes, a party can win if it has the greatest proportion of the votes

### Single-Member Districts (SMD)

- Plurality system
  - 
  - E.g. UK, US, Canada, India, Nigeria
- Just need to win the plurality of votes within a system

*Naturally, the US has a two-party system, because you can't vote for a third party without splitting the vote.*

Strengths:
- Simplicity - One representative accountable to the district

Weaknesses:
- Unrepresentative outcomes are likely, at a local and national level
  - If the representative is from party A, party A will get more representation than other parties

### Single Nontransferable Vote (SNTV)

- Similar to SMDs, but multiple candidates in a district
  - E.g. three seats = top three are elected
- Much less frequent: Afghanistan, Japan until 1994, Taiwan until 2005

Strengths:
- More representative, whilst maintaining some accountability (easy to kick someone out)

Weaknesses:
- Can encourage intra-party fighting
- Candidates from the same party standing against one another (as opposed to one candidate per party under SMD)

### Alternative Vote (AV)

- Absolute majority, NOT plurality
  - Rank order candidates, e.g. first choice, second choice, third choice, etc.
  - If no candidate wins 50%, the bottom candidate is eliminated, and their votes are reallocated (second -> first, third -> second) until there is a winner

Strengths:
- Still only one candidate per district, so high accountability
- Voters can express several preferences and have a better chance at their second preferred candidate getting in, if the first fails

Weaknesses:
- Complicated - Requires a great deal of information for voters to know about all of the parties/candidates, beyond their top preferred one

### Runoff Two-Round System

- Most common way of electing presidents around the world
  - First round of voting -> top two candidates go through to a second round

Strengths:
- First round tends to have a lot of parties
- Citizens can express lots of preferences

Weaknesses:
- Might still be forced to vote for undesirable candidate in the second round
- Significant costs

### Proportional (PR)

- Lots of variation
- If a party wins 10% of the vote, it should receive around 10% of the seats
- All have multi-member districts (districts have more than one person)
  - Although *district sizes differ*
  - Larger districts = more representation, but less accountability
- All use some kind of quota/divisor to determine who exactly is elected

Strengths:
- More proportional, better for overall representation - more people get their voice heard

Weaknesses:
- Small, extremist parties
- Government formation can be problematic

#### PR Factor #1: Quotas

Not all whole numbers: How to allocate 1/4 of a seat?
Most common variation: **d'Hondt formula**

#### PR Factor #2: District Magnitude

- The most important factor influencing the proportionality of a system
- How many representatives per district?
- Larger magnitude = more proportional

#### PR Factor #3: Electoral Thresholds

- A minimum percentage of votes a party/candidate must win before they can get a seat
  - Germany: 5%
  - Israel: 3.25%
  - Turkey: 10%
- Discourages smaller, extremist parties (e.g. Nazi party in Germany) and party system fragmentation

*Talk about these points in country case portfolio electoral systems:*

- Institutions vs. culture in determining outcomes
- For you, is there a perfect mix of accountability/representation?
- Which one is more important to you?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of different systems?

Gerrymandering/Malapportionment: Giving certain regions a higher proportion of one party's vote.

*There is strategic choice involved in the shaping of institutions.*
