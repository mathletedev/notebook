- Degree of survival
  - Often argued that parliamentary regimes are more likely to survive (Linz's argument in *The Perils of Presidentialism*)
- Tendency for different constitutional frameworks to produce legislative majorities

## Presidential Systems

- Most common system throughout the Americas
- President as head of state
- Emphasis on separation of powers

President *executes* laws, doesn't *implement* them.

## Parliamentary Systems

- Executive and legislature linked: former derives legitimacy from the latter
- Head of state usually different to head of government
- Most common in Europe and throughout the Caribbean

**Vote of no confidence**: Can forcibly remove a leader from government.

Two systems have different measures of **mutual accountability**.

## Mutual Independence (Presidential)

- Electorate select chief executive and then independently selects members of legislature
- A presidential democracy is therefore a *system of mutual independence of executive and legislature*

Government moves slowly, can't pull a kill switch.

## Mutual Dependence (Parliamentary)

- Electorate selects members of parliament and then MPs select an individual as head of government and chief executive (Prime Minister)
- Legislature can dismiss government through **vote of no confidence**
- Chief executive also has capacity to dissolve legislature and call for new elections

## Coalitions

- Especially common in parliamentary systems, particularly electoral systems of proportional representation
  - Multiple parties, emphasis on representativeness of broad variety of opinions amongst electorate
  - Many small parties can win seats in parliament
  - 80% of Western European governments in parliamentary democracies formed with no single party controlling majority of seats
- Two or more parties must contribute members to the government to survive a vote of no confidence

**Minimum winning coalitions**: Attract just enough support that you need, but don't want people far away from you ideologically.

**Principal-agent problem**: When an important person (principal) has an agent, but the agent faces a conflict of interest. The agent may not follow the principal's wishes.

## Juan Linz, The Perils of Presidentialism

- Presidentialism is more unstable than parliamentary systems
- Zero-sum elections:
  - Presidentialism is problematic because it operates according to the rule of "winner-takes-all", resulting in a zero-sum game and potential for conflict
- The style of presidential politics:
  - Two-dimensional: President is head of state and representative of entire nation, but he stands for a clearly partisan political opinion
- The problem of dual legitimacy:
  - A presidential cabinet is less likely than parliament to contain strong and independent-minded members
  - The officers of a president's cabinet hold their posts purely at the sufferance of their chief
  - Both a president and legislature can make a claim to legitimacy (when you fracture the power, fights can start)
- The issue of stability:
  - A prime minister who is bad can easily be removed, but a corrupt or highly unpopular president can't

## Why Should Parliamentary Regimes Be More Stable?

### Stepan and Skach (1993)

- Mutual dependence should encourage **reconciliation** between executive and legislative branches
- Mutual independence encourages **antagonism** -> leads to deadlock -> then my turn to the military to break stalemate
- But in parliamentary regimes there are votes of no confidence, and/or PM can dissolve parliament and call for new elections

What if it's all a *coincidence* that Latin America acquired presidential systems, but just went back to what they had prior to being democracies?
