- Degree of survival
  - Often argued that parliamentary regimes are more likely to survive (Linz's argument in *The Perils of Presidentialism*)
- Tendency for different constitutional frameworks to produce legislative majorities

## Presidential Systems

- Most common system throughout the Americas
- President as head of state
- Emphasis on separation of powers

President *executes* laws, doesn't *implement* them.

## Parliamentary Systems

- Executive and legislature linked: former derives legitimacy from the latter
- Head of state usually different to head of government
- Most common in Europe and throughout the Caribbean

**Vote of no confidence**: Can forcibly remove a leader from government.

Two systems have different measures of **mutual accountability**.

## Mutual Independence (Presidential)

- Electorate select chief executive and then independently selects members of legislature
- A presidential democracy is therefore a *system of mutual independence of executive and legislature*

Government moves slowly, can't pull a kill switch.

## Mutual Dependence (Parliamentary)

- Electorate selects members of parliament and then MPs select an individual as head of government and chief executive (Prime Minister)
- Legislature can dismiss government through **vote of no confidence**
- Chief executive also has capacity to dissolve legislature and call for new elections

## Coalitions

- Especially common in parliamentary systems, particularly electoral systems of proportional representation
  - Multiple parties, emphasis on representativeness of broad variety of opinions amongst electorate
  - Many small parties can win seats in parliament
  - 80% of Western European governments in parliamentary democracies formed with no single party controlling majority of seats
- Two or more parties must contribute members to the government to survive a vote of no confidence

**Minimum winning coalitions**: Attract just enough support that you need, but don't want people far away from you ideologically.

**Principal-agent problem**: When an important person (principal) has an agent, but the agent faces a conflict of interest. The agent may not follow the principal's wishes.
