## The Puzzle of State Strength

**Patrimonial**: Rulers claimed absolute power and treated the state as personal property but are ultimately weak due to exercising very limited control over their population/territory/staff.

**Despotic** vs. **infrastructural** power:

The radius of conquest was always larger than the radius of administration: Conquerors incorporated pre-existing power structures, while their delegated agents could amass considerable local autonomy.

**Principal-agent relations** and **loss of delegated power**: Rulers and agents may have distinct interests; asymmetric information.

## Rise of Modern State

- Patrimonial -> bureaucratic
- Unconstrained, unaccountable, personal rule -> impersonal administrative proceduralism and rule of law
- Mediated rule -> direct rule
- Administrative and cultural heterogeneity -> administrative and cultural uniformity

## Key Factors in Modern State Formation

1. Centralisation of power
2. Institutionalisation of power (substitution of civil servants governed by law for powerful local elites as agents of the state)
   - feudalism has to go
3. Increased extraction of resources
   - More bureaucrats, more soldiers
4. Increased regulation of society

AD 737: No trade routes into Europe; if traders went to Europe, they were enslaved. Europe is a trading "ghost town".

AD 1000: Vikings built ships that could reach many places.

AD 1212: Explosion of economic trade across European continent.

AD 1346: Many more trade routes.

AD 1483: A few years before Columbus's exploration of North America.

## Protestant Reformation and State Building

Cultural changes produce new forms of behaviour resulting in stronger states:

Protestant Reformation -> theological pressure for social discipline -> solutions to principal-agent problems -> state building

Original theorist: Max Weber
Contemporary version: Philip Gorski, *The Disciplinary Revoution*

Problem: Still a lot of Catholic countries, temporal issue

## Commercial Revolution and State Building

The emergence of a new class of proto-capitalists - merchants, manufacturers, financiers - who bargain with rulers to create the political conditions for greater wealth.

Economic revival -> demand for public goods -> formation of preferences over institutions -> coalitions with political entrepreneurs -> state building

Original theorist: Karl Marx
Contemporary version: Hendrik Spruyt, *The Sovereign State and its Competitors*

## Military Revolution and State Building

Given a European state system characterised by fragmented sovereignty, rulers under intense pressure to extract more resources from society and to centralise their rule.

Military revolution -> increased pressure on rulers -> increased demand for revenue & soldiers -> state building

You can't beat cannons with sabres... Must get revenue for defence.

*A powerful state can offer protection to a smaller state, in return for resources (money, soldiers, weapons).*
