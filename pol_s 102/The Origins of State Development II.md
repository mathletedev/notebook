## The Puzzle of State Strength

**Patrimonial**: Rulers claimed absolute power and treated the state as personal property but are ultimately weak due to exercising very limited control over their population/territory/staff.

**Despotic** vs. **infrastructural** power:

The radius of conquest was always larger than the radius of administration: Conquerors incorporated pre-existing power structures, while their delegated agents could amass considerable local autonomy.

**Principal-agent relations** and **loss of delegated power**: Rulers and agents may have distinct interests; asymmetric information.

## Rise of Modern State

- Patrimonial -> bureaucratic
- Unconstrained, unaccountable, personal rule -> impersonal administrative proceduralism and rule of law
- Mediated rule -> direct rule
- Administrative and cultural heterogeneity -> administrative and cultural uniformity

## Key Factors in Modern State Formation

1. Centralisation of power
2. Institutionalisation of power (substitution of civil servants governed by law for powerful local elites as agents of the state)
   - feudalism has to go
3. Increased extraction of resources
   - More bureaucrats, more soldiers
4. Increased regulation of society

AD 737: No trade routes into Europe; if traders went to Europe, they were enslaved. Europe is a trading "ghost town".

AD 1000: Vikings built ships that could reach many places.

AD 1212: Explosion of economic trade across European continent.

AD 1346: Many more trade routes.

AD 1483: A few years before Columbus's exploration of North America.

## Protestant Reformation and State Building

Cultural changes produce new forms of behaviour resulting in stronger states:

Protestant Reformation -> theological pressure for social discipline -> solutions to principal-agent problems -> state building

Original theorist: Max Weber
Contemporary version: Philip Gorski, *The Disciplinary Revoution*

Problem: Still a lot of Catholic countries, temporal issue

## Commercial Revolution and State Building

The emergence of a new class of proto-capitalists - merchants, manufacturers, financiers - who bargain with rulers to create the political conditions for greater wealth.

Economic revival -> demand for public goods -> formation of preferences over institutions -> coalitions with political entrepreneurs -> state building

Original theorist: Karl Marx
Contemporary version: Hendrik Spruyt, *The Sovereign State and its Competitors*

## Military Revolution and State Building

Given a European state system characterised by fragmented sovereignty, rulers under intense pressure to extract more resources from society and to centralise their rule.

Military revolution -> increased pressure on rulers -> increased demand for revenue & soldiers -> state building

You can't beat cannons with sabres... Must get revenue for defence.

*A powerful state can offer protection to a smaller state, in return for resources (money, soldiers, weapons).*

Henry IV vs. Colonel Tim Collins's speech
Henry IV:
- Proud of war, remembered in time

Colonel Tim Collins:
- Professional standing army with advanced weaponry
- Sombre tone
- Importance of life and respect for enemy

### What Happened?

1. Changes in the "Art of War"
  1. Massed, professional, disciplined infantry replace cavalry
  2. "Arms race" between development of cannon and development of advanced fortifications
2. Doubling (or more) of size of military relative population and government revenues
3. Shift from customary dues and irregular taxes to regular taxes

#### Mechanisms

- Predation: Confiscation through violence
- Bargaining and the creation of new institutions
  - Towns and cities: Money and militias for legal autonomy, institutional reforms, mercantilism
  - Church loses autonomy to rulers in exchange for reforms and state support in Protestant countries, counter-reformation in Catholic countries
  - Nobilities:
    - Provincial nobilities exempted from taxes in Spain
    - Local nobilities given access to state offices in France
    - Political centralisation and sovereignty for unconditional control over land and sometimes labour from Easter Europe / Russia

Balance between predation and bargaining shifts towards bargaining in the west, remains primarily predatory in the east.

## Why was Western Europe Different?

Outside of Western Europe (China, Japan, India, Russia, Ottoman Empire, Persia), rulers had incentives to fight wars and access to military technology, but the dynamics of warfare they confronted did not stimulate the dynamic cycle between **arms, money, and bureaucracy**.

While Europe was fragmented into hundreds of polities, China remained a unified empire and fought internal wars, not wars against other sovereign states. Furthermore, China's external wars were fought against nomads.

## Looking Forward: Post-Colonial States

Why are post-colonial states in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, weaker on average than European states?
