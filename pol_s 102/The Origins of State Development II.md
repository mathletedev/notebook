## The Puzzle of State Strength

**Patrimonial**: Rulers claimed absolute power and treated the state as personal property but are ultimately weak due to exercising very limited control over their population/territory/staff.

**Despotic** vs. **infrastructural** power:

The radius of conquest was always larger than the radius of administration: Conquerors incorporated pre-existing power structures, while their delegated agents could amass considerable local autonomy.

**Principal-agent relations** and **loss of delegated power**: Rulers and agents may have distinct interests; asymmetric information.

## Rise of Modern State

- Patrimonial -> bureaucratic
- Unconstrained, unaccountable, personal rule -> impersonal administrative proceduralism and rule of law
- Mediated rule -> direct rule
- Administrative and cultural heterogeneity -> administrative and cultural uniformity

## Key Factors in Modern State Formation

1. Centralisation of power
2. Institutionalisation of power (substitution of civil servants governed by law for powerful local elites as agents of the state)
   - feudalism has to go
3. Increased extraction of resources
   - More bureaucrats, more soldiers
4. Increased regulation of society

AD 737: No trade routes into Europe; if traders went to Europe, they were enslaved. Europe is a trading "ghost town".

AD 1000: Vikings built ships that could reach many places.

AD 1212: Explosion of economic trade across European continent.

AD 1346: Many more trade routes.

AD 1483: A few years before Columbus's exploration of North America.

## Protestant Reformation and State Building

Cultural changes produce new forms of behaviour resulting in stronger states:

Protestant Reformation -> theological pressure for social discipline -> solutions to principal-agent problems -> state building

Original theorist: Max Weber
Contemporary version: Philip Gorski, *The Disciplinary Revoution*

Problem: Still a lot of Catholic countries, temporal issue

## Commercial Revolution and State Building

The emergence of a new class of proto-capitalists - merchants, manufacturers, financiers - who bargain with rulers to create the political conditions for greater wealth.

Economic revival -> demand for public goods -> formation of preferences over institutions -> coalitions with political entrepreneurs -> state building

Original theorist: Karl Marx
Contemporary version: Hendrik Spruyt, *The Sovereign State and its Competitors*

## Military Revolution and State Building

Given a European state system characterised by fragmented sovereignty, rulers under intense pressure to extract more resources from society and to centralise their rule.

Military revolution -> increased pressure on rulers -> increased demand for revenue & soldiers -> state building

You can't beat cannons with sabres... Must get revenue for defence.

*A powerful state can offer protection to a smaller state, in return for resources (money, soldiers, weapons).*

Henry IV vs. Colonel Tim Collins's speech
Henry IV:
- Proud of war, remembered in time

Colonel Tim Collins:
- Professional standing army with advanced weaponry
- Sombre tone
- Importance of life and respect for enemy

### What Happened?

1. Changes in the "Art of War"
  1. Massed, professional, disciplined infantry replace cavalry
  2. "Arms race" between development of cannon and development of advanced fortifications
2. Doubling (or more) of size of military relative population and government revenues
3. Shift from customary dues and irregular taxes to regular taxes

#### Mechanisms

- Predation: Confiscation through violence
- Bargaining and the creation of new institutions
  - Towns and cities: Money and militias for legal autonomy, institutional reforms, mercantilism
  - Church loses autonomy to rulers in exchange for reforms and state support in Protestant countries, counter-reformation in Catholic countries
  - Nobilities:
    - Provincial nobilities exempted from taxes in Spain
    - Local nobilities given access to state offices in France
    - Political centralisation and sovereignty for unconditional control over land and sometimes labour from Easter Europe / Russia

Balance between predation and bargaining shifts towards bargaining in the west, remains primarily predatory in the east.

## Why was Western Europe Different?

Outside of Western Europe (China, Japan, India, Russia, Ottoman Empire, Persia), rulers had incentives to fight wars and access to military technology, but the dynamics of warfare they confronted did not stimulate the dynamic cycle between **arms, money, and bureaucracy**.

While Europe was fragmented into hundreds of polities, China remained a unified empire and fought internal wars, not wars against other sovereign states. Furthermore, China's external wars were fought against nomads.

## Looking Forward: Post-Colonial States

Why are post-colonial states in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, weaker on average than European states?

## Three Broad Types of Post-Colonial States

Evans, Predatory, Developmental, and other Apparatuses (1989)

- Predatory:
  - "True to patrimonial tradition, control of the state apparatus is vested in *a small group of personalistically interconnected individuals*".
  - This makes "... the development of a bourgeoisie oriented towards long-term profit-based productive investment almost an impossibility".
- Developmental:
  - Interventionism to spur industrial development, aiming to becoming competitive in international markets.
  - Begin with low-end manufacturing and cheap labour.
  - Emphasis on rapid expansion of **exports**.
- Intermediary:
  - Lack of generalised meritocratic recruitment and hence political leaders try to create *pockets of efficiency* within the bureaucracy.

### Predatory States

- Legacy of colonial policies that consolidate power of local intermediaries ruling through personal authority
- At independence, neo-patrimonial rulers use state apparatus to extract personal wealth
  - Staff highest echelons of the state with loyal followers
- Absence of bureaucratic coherence, regularised administrative procedures, and rule of law
  - State apparatus, therefore, incapable of executing rudimentary development projects
- Weak states subsidised by international system (and, in some, exports of oil, diamonds, etc.)

#### Example: Nigeria (1970-1980)

- Gains independence in 1960
  - Leading up to this, elites had consulted with the British on emerging industry and pressures for decolonisation in the country
- These elites further secure their positions following independence
  - E.g. positions in government, business licenses, rights to running water and electricity granted to elites' supporters
- Elites operate outside the law: subdue and dissent minority

High despotic power, low infrastructural power

### Developmental States: "East Asian Miracle"

- Coherent, meritocratic bureaucracy -> high levels of infrastructural power
- Bureaucratic autonomy: Efforts to minimise intervention by political or business elites in policy-making
- *Embedded autonomy*: Complex relationship of interdependence and cooperation between autonomous and highly capable bureaucracy and private corporations

#### Example: South Korea (1960-)

- Coup 1961: Political/economic instability

#### Conditions for Developmental States

... are very limited. Some particular conditions paved the way for the East Asian Miracle:

- Distinct colonial experiences: Japanese colonialism in Korea and Taiwan paved the way for the transfer of the Japanese developmental state to former colonies.
- Land reform: Remove powerful intermediaries between state and society, allows for stronger bureaucratic states.
- War and state building: Tense security environment of East Asia produces stronger states.
- Resource scarcity precludes reliance on wealth from mineral exports

### Intermediary States

- Intermediate levels of infrastructural power based on uneasy balance between developmentalism and corruption
- "Pockets of efficiency":
  - Specific agencies follow bureaucratic logic, but these effective agencies are surrounded by corruption and imperfectly protected from either political intervention or rent-seeking behaviour by economic firms
- Therefore, professionally executed developmental projects are not the norm

#### Example: Argentina

- Import Substitution Industrialisation (ISI)
- Protectionism against imports, heavy reliance on primary exports

Problem: Own citizens can't even afford goods produced in own country

## What Distinguishes These States?

- Levels of infrastructural/despotic power!
- Somewhere like North Korea may have high despotic power
  - But little infrastructural power: Low incentives for economic growth and state development in the same way Europe unfolded
- Predatory states still quite abundant in the world
- Developmental states have managed to increase their infrastructural power rapidly
  - But again, according to very different path compared to Europe
- Intermediary states are somewhere in the middle

## Questions to Think About

- Did your countries centralise their state?
  - Did they follow European/Western trajectory e.g. military revolution?
  - Or do they fit into one of the three postcolonial categories?
    - Or something different?
- But beyond this, broader implications/questions:
  - **Environmental limitations** and **limits to capitalist growth**: We cannot possibly all follow the US/European model to state development and economic development
  - State power is not unbreakable: "Great" empires do fall after all
    - New power vacuums, e.g. collapse of the British Empire
    - Will the "dependency curse" break?
  - BRICs and rise of new nations through different economic policies
