## Political Identity

The ways that individuals categorise themselves and others, and how they understand the power relationships of domination and oppression that exist between groups.

Question: Why are some forms of identity politicised?

Even in countries with considerable diversity, everyone is mostly peaceful.

## Political Identity

Two major thinkers on the sources of political identity:
- **Karl Marx**: One's *economic position in society* is the primary way in which people think about individual and collective political identity.
- **Max Weber**: Identity is primarily non-economic in origin, formed primarily among groups of people who share *an understanding of a common heritage* based on religion, race, or the related concepts of ethnicity, language, territory, or familial ties.

Warning: Discussing political identity is *not* necessarily the same thing as discussing Identity politics as a theory.

## Marx, Materialism, and Class Consciousness

- The **class cleavage** arises during the industrial revolution, then spreads throughout the world.
  - Mutates and evolves into different forms; e.g. Marxism-Leninism
- Workers and bourgeoisie form identities around these economic interests.
  - I.e. their interests are based on *economic material conditions*
  - Recall the materialist vs. postmaterialist divide
- Marx *acknowledges other forms of oppression*, especially women's oppression, horrors of colonialism, and racism.
  - "Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"
- But ultimately, *capitalism and economic interests are the sources of identity*, conflict, and oppression.
  - All other identities are mere distractions from the bigger problem (the class divide)

## Weber and Cultural Identity

- Rooted more in *cultural beliefs and symbols*
  - E.g. the markers (food, flags, music, art, phrases, dress, etc.) of cultures, ethnicities, and groups.
- His argument focuses on ethnicity and religion to start
  - The theory has branched out since then, and now encompasses a variety of different possible identities
- So, according to this argument, one group of people - along ethnic lines, for example - would be more likely to behave/vote a certain way
  - Regardless of class/economic background
- Of course, this differs from context to context: Compare the U.K. and India

## Summarising the Arguments

- On one hand: *Economic interests are fixed; an immutable reality*
  - Sure, you may "better" yourself and get a higher-paying job OR lose wealth
  - But you can't identify out of your income bracket
  - Culture can play a role, but ultimately it is the economic, material conditions that shape the culture
- On the other hand: *Identity is cultural and crosses economic and material conditions*
  - The construction of symbols, social cues, mannerisms, etc. is primary
- Recall arguments about postmaterialism
  - Shift from traditional, material values to secular-rational and self-expression values

## What is Primordialism?

- Primordial thinking about identity asserts that:
  - Identity is rooted in human nature or at least is the subject of fundamental and intense attachment/aversion that is relatively resistant to change.
  - Identity produces deeply rooted affective ties that are fixed, immutable, inherently linked to conflict, given, and natural.
  - Identities are a fundamental and durable form of affiliation characterised by intense feelings.
    - It is an end in and of itself because it satisfies the human need for community.
- Identity is usually treated as the independent variable by primordialists - i.e. as the treatment or explanation.
  - It is a phenomenon rather than an epiphenomenon.

## Primordialism's Strengths and Weaknesses

- Strengths
  - May help explain:
    - The intensity and durability of ethnic affiliation and the sentiments that frequently flow from them: Affection, hatred, and willingness to sacrifice
    - How political actors see identity
- Weaknesses
  - Neglects changes in identity content, salience, and mobilisation
  - Little insight into when or how identities translate into political organising and action in some cases and not others
  - Can't explain variation, especially in degree and kind of conflict
  - Can't explain new identities or conflicts

## What is Constructivism?

- Identity is shaped and given meaning by social, structural forces including discourse, frames, symbols, social practices, institutions, power dynamics, and more.
- It is "constructed" and not a given. This construction determines an identity's content, boundaries, and relation to other identities.
- It clearly acknowledges how endogeneity is involved in identity formation.
  - The state helps create identities and reifies them
  - Individuals internalise them

## Constructivism's Strengths and Weaknesses

Strengths:
- Better able to explain cross-national variation in emergence and salience of political identity because it allows individuals to choose and consciously attach political significance to identity
- Better able to explain cross-national variation in emergence and salience of political identity because it focuses on how the socio-political context shapes, constrains, and constructs individual choices

Weaknesses:
- Unable to make sense of the way most people perceive their own identities
- Difficult to identify the precise mechanism by which identity becomes politically salient for millions of people and is transmitted from one generation to the next

## How Does Identity Become Polarised?

Primordialists don't give us a lot of answers to this question.

Constructivist argument:
Long-term social, economic, or technological change because someone or some group had an interest in that outcome

## Different Ways of Thinking of Representation

- Descriptive
  - Whether representatives resemble their constituents along various identities
  - Assumption is members of those groups share policy preferences
- Symbolic
  - Implies that a representative symbolises a constituency (Stokke & Selboe 2009)
    - Monarchs symbolising a nation
    - Different from descriptive, which says representative bodies should reflect the composition of people who are being represented
- Substantive
  - Whether representative take actions in line with the substantive and ideological interests of those they represent

## The Politics of Gender

Gender as a category:
- A form of socially constructed political identity that considers variation in the social meaning of masculinity and femininity around the world.

Gender as a process (Beckwith 2005):
- The differential effects of structures and policies upon women and men.
- The means by which masculine and feminine actors (often men and women, but not perfectly congruent, and often individuals but also structures) actively work to produce favourable gendered outcomes.

## Htun: Is Gender Like Ethnicity?

Candidate quotas for cross-cutting groups; seat reservations for coinciding ones
- Candidate quotas are more appropriate for groups that crosscut partisan cleavages, while reservations suit groups that coincide with them.
- Gender identities tend to cut across parties, whereas ethnic identities often overlap with partisan affiliations.
- Consequently, disadvantaged groups that are defined by gender demand, and are granted, candidate quotas; ethnic groups prefer, and receive, legislative reservations.
- Candidate quotas intervene in party nomination procedures by requiring that a certain percentage of the candidates fielded by a party be of a certain group.
- Seat reservations, by contrast, guarantee group members a share of power independently, if need be, of existing parties.
  - Separate electoral rolls, special electoral districts that can limit competition to group members, exceptions to counting rules, and provisions for direct appointment to the legislature
