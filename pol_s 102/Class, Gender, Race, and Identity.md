## Political Identity

The ways that individuals categorise themselves and others, and how they understand the power relationships of domination and oppression that exist between groups.

Question: Why are some forms of identity politicised?

Even in countries with considerable diversity, everyone is mostly peaceful.

## Political Identity

Two major thinkers on the sources of political identity:
- **Karl Marx**: One's *economic position in society* is the primary way in which people think about individual and collective political identity.
- **Max Weber**: Identity is primarily non-economic in origin, formed primarily among groups of people who share *an understanding of a common heritage* based on religion, race, or the related concepts of ethnicity, language, territory, or familial ties.

Warning: Discussing political identity is *not* necessarily the same thing as discussing Identity politics as a theory.

## Marx, Materialism, and Class Consciousness

- The **class cleavage** arises during the industrial revolution, then spreads throughout the world.
  - Mutates and evolves into different forms; e.g. Marxism-Leninism
- Workers and bourgeoisie form identities around these economic interests.
  - I.e. their interests are based on *economic material conditions*
  - Recall the materialist vs. postmaterialist divide
- Marx *acknowledges other forms of oppression*, especially women's oppression, horrors of colonialism, and racism.
  - "Social progress can be measured by the social position of the female sex"
- But ultimately, *capitalism and economic interests are the sources of identity*, conflict, and oppression.
  - All other identities are mere distractions from the bigger problem (the class divide)

## Weber and Cultural Identity

- Rooted more in *cultural beliefs and symbols*
  - E.g. the markers (food, flags, music, art, phrases, dress, etc.) of cultures, ethnicities, and groups.
- His argument focuses on ethnicity and religion to start
  - The theory has branched out since then, and now encompasses a variety of different possible identities
- So, according to this argument, one group of people - along ethnic lines, for example - would be more likely to behave/vote a certain way
  - Regardless of class/economic background
- Of course, this differs from context to context: Compare the U.K. and India

## Summarising the Arguments

- On one hand: *Economic interests are fixed; an immutable reality*
  - Sure, you may "better" yourself and get a higher-paying job OR lose wealth
  - But you can't identify out of your income bracket
  - Culture can play a role, but ultimately it is the economic, material conditions that shape the culture
- On the other hand: *Identity is cultural and crosses economic and material conditions*
  - The construction of symbols, social cues, mannerisms, etc. is primary
- Recall arguments about postmaterialism
  - Shift from traditional, material values to secular-rational and self-expression values

## What is Primordialism?

- Primordial thinking about identity asserts that:
  - Identity is rooted in human nature or at least is the subject of fundamental and intense attachment/aversion that is relatively resistant to change.
  - Identity produces deeply rooted affective ties that are fixed, immutable, inherently linked to conflict, given, and natural.
  - Identities are a fundamental and durable form of affiliation characterised by intense feelings.
    - It is an end in and of itself because it satisfies the human need for community.
- Identity is usually treated as the independent variable by primordialists - i.e. as the treatment or explanation.
  - It is a phenomenon rather than an epiphenomenon.

## Primordialism's Strengths and Weaknesses

- Strengths
  - May help explain:
    - The intensity and durability of ethnic affiliation and the sentiments that frequently flow from them: Affection, hatred, and willingness to sacrifice
    - How political actors see identity
- Weaknesses
  - Neglects changes in identity content, salience, and mobilisation
  - Little insight into when or how identities translate into political organising and action in some cases and not others
  - Can't explain variation, especially in degree and kind of conflict
  - Can't explain new identities or conflicts
