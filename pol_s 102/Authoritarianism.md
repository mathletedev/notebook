## Autocratic Institutions

1. Autocratic regimes have specific dynamics because unlike democracies, there are no established procedures and rules for changing the government.
  - There may be rules for changing the chief executive (esp. on the death of the existing chief executive).
2. Autocratic regimes have institutions that are at least partially intended to manage their specific political dynamics
  - Just as there are varieties of democratic regimes, there are varieties of autocratic regimes.
3. These distinctive institutions may have consequences for autocratic survival.
  - The death of an autocratic regime is not the same as a democratic transition; inter-autocratic regime transitions are possible.

## Internal Dynamics of Authoritarian Regimes

- Dictatorships contain core ruling elite whose members are the most critical bass of support of a dictatorship and who thus critical positions in the state and government.
- Dictators are often disposed by members of their own support coalition - call this a palace coup, a change of leadership without a change of regime.
- Therefore, managing this support coalition is a major dynamic of authoritarian politics.
- Simultaneously, autocrats have to worry about two other sources of challenge:
  - Groups of elites excluded from the current authoritarian regime who wish to create a new autocratic regime under their control.
  - Popular uprisings and insurgencies, possibly in support of democracy.

### Types of Dictatorship

2008: 74 dictatorships around the world
- 38 (51.4%) were civilian
- 24 (32.4%) were military
- 12 (16.2%) were monarchies

## A Second Typology of Authoritarian Regimes

- Military: Officers determine who rules and who influences policy
- Personalistic: All decisions depend on discretion of an individual leader
- Single-party: Access to political office and control over policy are dominated by one party

Most authoritarian regimes combine two or more features.

## Monarchic Dictatorships

- Reliance on family/kin network to stay in and continue power
- A royal family in power
  - NOT the same as constitutional monarchies (democracies) e.g. UK, Spain, Sweden, Sweden, etc.
- Nowadays, most common in the Middle East; e.g. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait
- Tend to be more stable and less violent; some property rights and economic growth
  - Why? Clear rules as to who the insiders and outsiders are (less ambiguity around power if people aren't born into it)
  - Rules or norms that indicate exactly how regime rents are to be shared among the various members of the royal family
  - Institutions that allow members of the royal family to monitor the actions of the monarch and enforce the norms regarding the distribution of regime rents

## Military Dictatorships

- Military leaders form a **junta** (a type of committee)
- Values of discipline, cohesiveness, autonomy from civilian intervention
- Are usually volatile and short-lived
- But even if they step down, they remain a credible force: Democracies have to take into account the possibility for future coups
  - Recall the debate about [[Presidential vs. Parliamentary Systems|presidential regimes]] and democratic breakdown: Large majority of these were military dictatorships previously

## Civilian Dictatorships

- Must create an institutional base for support
- Dominant-party:
  - One party regimes e.g. Communist Party of the Soviet Union
    - Members of the party turn into elites; become socialised into the system
  - Second longest-lived dictatorships
  - When encountering crises: Grant moderate increases in political participation and representation for opposition
- Personalist dictatorships:
  - Still supported by a party/military, but leader has more control e.g. North Korea
