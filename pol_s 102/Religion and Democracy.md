## Weber

### The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism (1905)

- Protestant emphasis on individual responsibility
- Conducive to capitalism
- Creates a bourgeoisie
  - Robust middle class that helps spur further economic development
- Contrast to Catholicism
  - Emphasis on hierarchy (the Pope) as opposed to individual reading and connection with God
    - Martin Luther
  - Historical examples: Spain and Italy

## Fish

### Islam and Democracy (2002)

- Muslim majority countries -> female subordination -> authoritarianism
- Evidence
  - 149 countries and "Freedom House scores"
  - Finds that on average, Muslim majority countries (>50% of population) are more likely to be authoritarian
  - Looks at other factors such as lower female literacy scores, sex-ratio imbalances
- Link between religion and female subordination
  - Claim that these imbalances reflect in social relations within the family
  - Unquestioned leadership of the father -> culture of domination and intolerance

Note: Fish's data does not cover the entire human timeline. Female subordination existed very early on, yet there are countries that have a democracy now.

## Strengths and Weaknesses of Political Culture Theories

### Strengths

- Bottom-up -> captures agency/power of citizens
- Strength of contemporary nationalist movement/right-wing populism
  - Desire for community ties in light of Bowling Alone?
- Operationalisation/measurement: Some good survey questions
  - Multiple ways of understanding culture

### Weaknesses

- Assumption of homogeneity (must assume to arrive at these theories)
- Selection bias of countries
  - Inglehart only focuses on industrial countries
  - Over-samples wealthy democracies
  - Missing later democracies
- Poor measurement (technology is better today, e.g. Excel)
  - Huntington: Hard-to-define mixture of ethnicity and language, and a residual category (Latin America)

## Political Institution Theories

Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behaviour to achieve certain outcomes.
Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behaviour and punish violations.

Important for political institutions: **Representation**, **accountability**

Institutions are sometimes groups of people (e.g. WSU).
Driving on the right side of the road is an instutition.

### John Locke

Give up some rights for other rights. Because of driving laws, we don't need to spend extra energy deciding how to drive.

Biggest difference between political institutions vs. political cultures: *Political institutions can be changed.*

*Institutions are rules of the game coordinated to achieve a specific outcome.*

## Three Big Lessons

1. For every example of institutions that work in the way intended by their designers, there are plenty of other examples that do not work as intended.
2. Sometimes when institutions work, it is because they reflect the underlying balance of power.
3. Pay attention to the origins of institutions because they may reflect strategic decisions by powerful actors.
