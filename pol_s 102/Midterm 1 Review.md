Theories of political culture say:
- There is a "congruence" between some features of culture and some features of politics.
- Values, norms, beliefs, opinions, tastes, desires, symbols can be causes of political outcomes.

Theories of political institutions say:
- Institutions are the "rules of the game" that are designed to coordinate behaviour to achieve certain outcomes.
- Institutions aim to encourage certain types of behaviour and punish violations of these rules.

Theories of political economy say:
- Behaviour is the product of rational decision making to satisfy economic interests.
- Different types of ways of organising the economy leads to different types of political organisaitons.
- Diverse interests produce political conflict because political institutions and policies have significant distributional consequences.

**Inglehart, Fish**: Emphasis on shared values in political culture, rather than conflict.

Every individual is trying to maximise endowment.
Because each individual is trying to maximise, individuals come into conflict with one another.

Three main points:

**Endowments**: Material one has under one's control.
- E.g. property, financial capital, technology
- Can potentially generate income

**Rational Decision-Making**: The procedure by which a decision is based.
- *Not* the content or the substance (not necessarily selfish, e.g. charities)
- A rational individual makes conscious choices, chooses option which maximises utility (or status)
- Two constraints:
  - Decision-makers can always prefer one of two options or be utterly indifferent (ruling out someone who really doesn't know)
  - **Transitive preferences**: If an individual prefers A over B, and B over C, then that individual prefers A over C
    - If this doesn't hold true, there isn't a fixed and stable outcome

**Conflict**: Individuals with different endowments typically want different things.
- E.g. farmers want land for agriculture, developers want land for houses
  - Workers want high salaries, employers want low salaries
- An option that benefits one individual may not benefit another individual
- Most times, people make concessions, but the times they don't is what we care about

**Major implication**: Rational actors will care about who forms the government, what policies they pursue, and what institutions are in place because policies and institutions have distributive conflicts; they have influence over the returns we get on our endowments!

If benefits of compliance outweigh the costs of changing the rules, actors will typically follow the rules (although some will cheat).
Vice versa: Actors will attempt to change the rules if there is a lower cost than the benefits of compliance.

## Acemoglu & Robinson
- Inclusive vs. Extractive Economic Institutions
  - Inclusive = pluralistic and centralised (multiple perspectives in the room)
    - Power is distributed broadly
    - State enforces law and order, provides public services, and regulates economic activites
  - Extractive = absolutist and decentralised
    - Power is narrow and unconstrained
    - The central state has little control over law and order, public services, and economic regulation

**Credible commitment problem**: An individual may not keep a promise if there is too little incentive to follow through with the promise.
- Government enforces **contracts** to solve this problem
- Solution to credible commitment problem in a political setting is to *distribute power* (e.g. king gives some power to parliament)

**Mobile assets**: Assets that can be easily moved to other countries/governments. Not bound to a single government. *Credible exit threat.*

**Autonomous**: Government is not dependent on any resource-holders from its citizenry to generate its income.

*Representative government is more likely to emerge and survive when the government is reliant on many citizens with mobile assets.*

## The Two Koreas

- North and South Korea experience a bifurcated economic trajectory after the end of the Korean War
  - Crucially, both are initially managed by authoritarian governments
- South Korea (influenced by US) recognises private property rights and heavily invests in various firms and industries
  - Also invest heavily in education, achieving high rates of literacy and schooling
- North Korea outlaws private property and a pluralistic market
  - Education is propaganda first and foremost if at all
- South Korea fully transitions to inclusive economic institutions and democracy in the 1980s
  - A&R: "The economic elite had little to gain from their own or the military's dominance of politics."
  - A&R: "Equality of income in South Korea also meant that the elite had less to fear from pluralism and democracy"

## Critiques of Political Economy Approaches

- Modernisation Theory still in dispute
  - Variants gaining more popularity
- Other contemporary examples, especially China: Stronger economy, but not necessarily democratic
- Class conflict -> What about "culture wars" and nationalistic populism?
  - Political and economic institutions can mitigate conflicts of interest
    - E.g. China
    - E.g. US: Highly economically unequal society, yet other issues motivate voters (post-material concerns)
    
## Things to Remember

- **Accountability** and **representation** in political institutions
- We are trying to falsify hypotheses
