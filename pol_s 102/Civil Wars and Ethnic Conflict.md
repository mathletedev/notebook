## Civil War

Persistent armed conflict between government and one or more armed and organised groups that results in a rupture of sovereignty in which the state loses uncontested control over some portion of its territory and population.

Distinguished from state repression: Many casualties on both sides

## Three Explanations for Civil Wars

- Opportunity, greed, and grievance
- Income as measure, and three hypotheses:
  - As a proxy measure of *state capacity (opportunity/institutions)*
    - Civil wars occur when the state is weak and cannot effectively police its own territory and population
  - As a proxy measure of *opportunity costs (greed/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur in the presence of valuable economic resources that can be controlled by opportunistic armed groups or secessionist movements
  - As a direct measure of *economic hardship (grievance/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur when extractive economic institutions cause economic distress and exploitation

## Opportunity: Fearon and Laitin

- Civil wars do not reflect grievances; especially not the ethnic grievances which appeared to be very important in many civil wars that erupted after the end of the cold war.
- Given a constant background state of grievance, civil wars reflect opportunities: Aggrieved people join insurgencies when they judge the probability of successful repression to be relatively low.
- Civil wars reflect two conditions influencing the feasibility of insurgency.
  - Infrastructurally weak states
  - Mountainous terrain (more places for insurgents to hide)

## The "State Capacity" Hypothesis

- How do most civil wars begin? Insurgencies:
  - A technology of military conflict characterised by small, lightly armed bands practising guerrilla warfare from rural base areas
  - At the onset of insurgency, rebel forces are weak compared to the government
    - Will only form when potential insurgents have reasons to believe they can survive and build strength over time
- Insurgents survive due to:
  - Asymmetric information
  - Local support / foreign sanctuaries
  - Special conditions that provide protection such as mountainous terrain.
  - Infrastructurally weak states

## Measuring State Capacity

- If insurgencies are more likely when states are relatively weak, we need a measure of state capacity.
- Fearon and Laitin use national income as a **proxy** measure of state capacity.
  - Higher income = Higher administrative, policing, and military capacity
  - Higher income = Better means of transportation and communication; rural communities that have been penetrated by state agencies
  - At lower levels of income, insurgent groups will have an easier time recruiting members because of lower opportunity costs

## Income and Opportunity Cost

**Opportunity costs**: Loss of potential gain from the next-best alternative when one alternative is chosen.

Richer country = more employment opportunities for young people = higher opportunity costs

## Greed

- Civil wars are more likely with greater lootable resources, especially oil;
- Oil provides incentive to form rebel groups to capture oil rents control over oil resources finances rebel groups.
  - But may also boost national income, which can deter insurgencies
- So, oil provides both motive and opportunity.
- Therefore, we should see correlations between availability of lootable resources and probability of civil war, particularly in low-income countries.

## Grievance: Economic Institutions, Inequality, and Civil War

**Median Voter Theorem**: Under certain conditions, the median voter is a Condorcet winner.

Income distributions are *always* skewed to the right: The existence of a small number of extremely rich households pulls the distribution to the right and means that the mean will be higher than the media.

Therefore, the income of the median voter in a democracy will always be less than the average income; the media voter will be relatively poor. In an autocracy, on the other hand, the "media voter" is rich.

## Grievance: Boix, Civil Wars, and Guerrilla Warfare

Implications of the Median Voter Theorem:
- The median voter in a democracy will therefore always (in theory) prefer higher redistributive taxes that transfer income from rich to poor, while the median voter in an autocracy will prefer no taxes.
- Furthermore, the size of the redistributive taxation increases with income inequality: As income inequality increases, the gap between rich and poor increases and so the median voter will make higher demands.

Some assets are relatively easy to tax; other assets are more difficult to tax.

Asset specificity: The extent to which capital can be moved abroad or not
- Land or oil wells = high specificity, low mobility
- High-level skills or liquid capital = low specificity, high mobility

Political violence should erupt as income inequality and asset specificity increases.

## Ethnic Conflict

"Conventional" wisdom: Primordial cultures, irrational and ancient hatreds, such that given sociocultural heterogeneity, inter-ethnic conflict is a "natural" outcome.

- Hutus vs. Tutsis, Rwanda
- Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, former Yugoslavia
- Africans vs. Arabs, Sudan
- Shias vs. Sunnies vs. Kurds, Iraq
- Jews vs. Palestinians, Israel
- Turks vs. Kurds, Turkey

## Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalisation Index

ELF index is used by social scientists to measure the probability that two individuals selected at random from a given country are NOT members of the same ethnic group.
