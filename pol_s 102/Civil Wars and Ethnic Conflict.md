## Civil War

Persistent armed conflict between government and one or more armed and organised groups that results in a rupture of sovereignty in which the state loses uncontested control over some portion of its territory and population.

Distinguished from state repression: Many casualties on both sides

## Three Explanations for Civil Wars

- Opportunity, greed, and grievance
- Income as measure, and three hypotheses:
  - As a proxy measure of *state capacity (opportunity/institutions)*
    - Civil wars occur when the state is weak and cannot effectively police its own territory and population
  - As a proxy measure of *opportunity costs (greed/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur in the presence of valuable economic resources that can be controlled by opportunistic armed groups or secessionist movements
  - As a direct measure of *economic hardship (grievance/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur when extractive economic institutions cause economic distress and exploitation

## Opportunity: Fearon and Laitin

- Civil wars do not reflect grievances; especially not the ethnic grievances which appeared to be very important in many civil wars that erupted after the end of the cold war.
- Given a constant background state of grievance, civil wars reflect opportunities: Aggrieved people join insurgencies when they judge the probability of successful repression to be relatively low.
- Civil wars reflect two conditions influencing the feasibility of insurgency.
  - Infrastructurally weak states
  - Mountainous terrain (more places for insurgents to hide)

## The "State Capacity" Hypothesis

- How do most civil wars begin? Insurgencies:
  - A technology of military conflict characterised by small, lightly armed bands practising guerrilla warfare from rural base areas
  - At the onset of insurgency, rebel forces are weak compared to the government
    - Will only form when potential insurgents have reasons to believe they can survive and build strength over time
- Insurgents survive due to:
  - Asymmetric information
  - Local support / foreign sanctuaries
  - Special conditions that provide protection such as mountainous terrain.
  - Infrastructurally weak states

## Measuring State Capacity

- If insurgencies are more likely when states are relatively weak, we need a measure of state capacity.
- Fearon and Laitin use national income as a **proxy** measure of state capacity.
  - Higher income = Higher administrative, policing, and military capacity
  - Higher income = Better means of transportation and communication; rural communities that have been penetrated by state agencies
  - At lower levels of income, insurgent groups will have an easier time recruiting members because of lower opportunity costs
