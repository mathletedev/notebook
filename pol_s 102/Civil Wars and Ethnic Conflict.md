## Civil War

Persistent armed conflict between government and one or more armed and organised groups that results in a rupture of sovereignty in which the state loses uncontested control over some portion of its territory and population.

Distinguished from state repression: Many casualties on both sides

## Three Explanations for Civil Wars

- Opportunity, greed, and grievance
- Income as measure, and three hypotheses:
  - As a proxy measure of *state capacity (opportunity/institutions)*
    - Civil wars occur when the state is weak and cannot effectively police its own territory and population
  - As a proxy measure of *opportunity costs (greed/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur in the presence of valuable economic resources that can be controlled by opportunistic armed groups or secessionist movements
  - As a direct measure of *economic hardship (grievance/economy)*
    - Civil wars occur when extractive economic institutions cause economic distress and exploitation

## Opportunity: Fearon and Laitin

- Civil wars do not reflect grievances; especially not the ethnic grievances which appeared to be very important in many civil wars that erupted after the end of the cold war.
- Given a constant background state of grievance, civil wars reflect opportunities: Aggrieved people join insurgencies when they judge the probability of successful repression to be relatively low.
- Civil wars reflect two conditions influencing the feasibility of insurgency.
  - Infrastructurally weak states
  - Mountainous terrain (more places for insurgents to hide)

## The "State Capacity" Hypothesis

- How do most civil wars begin? Insurgencies:
  - A technology of military conflict characterised by small, lightly armed bands practising guerrilla warfare from rural base areas
  - At the onset of insurgency, rebel forces are weak compared to the government
    - Will only form when potential insurgents have reasons to believe they can survive and build strength over time
- Insurgents survive due to:
  - Asymmetric information
  - Local support / foreign sanctuaries
  - Special conditions that provide protection such as mountainous terrain.
  - Infrastructurally weak states

## Measuring State Capacity

- If insurgencies are more likely when states are relatively weak, we need a measure of state capacity.
- Fearon and Laitin use national income as a **proxy** measure of state capacity.
  - Higher income = Higher administrative, policing, and military capacity
  - Higher income = Better means of transportation and communication; rural communities that have been penetrated by state agencies
  - At lower levels of income, insurgent groups will have an easier time recruiting members because of lower opportunity costs

## Income and Opportunity Cost

**Opportunity costs**: Loss of potential gain from the next-best alternative when one alternative is chosen.

Richer country = more employment opportunities for young people = higher opportunity costs

## Greed

- Civil wars are more likely with greater lootable resources, especially oil;
- Oil provides incentive to form rebel groups to capture oil rents control over oil resources finances rebel groups.
  - But may also boost national income, which can deter insurgencies
- So, oil provides both motive and opportunity.
- Therefore, we should see correlations between availability of lootable resources and probability of civil war, particularly in low-income countries.

## Grievance: Economic Institutions, Inequality, and Civil War

**Median Voter Theorem**: Under certain conditions, the median voter is a Condorcet winner.

Income distributions are *always* skewed to the right: The existence of a small number of extremely rich households pulls the distribution to the right and means that the mean will be higher than the media.

Therefore, the income of the median voter in a democracy will always be less than the average income; the media voter will be relatively poor. In an autocracy, on the other hand, the "media voter" is rich.

## Grievance: Boix, Civil Wars, and Guerrilla Warfare

Implications of the Median Voter Theorem:
- The median voter in a democracy will therefore always (in theory) prefer higher redistributive taxes that transfer income from rich to poor, while the median voter in an autocracy will prefer no taxes.
- Furthermore, the size of the redistributive taxation increases with income inequality: As income inequality increases, the gap between rich and poor increases and so the median voter will make higher demands.

Some assets are relatively easy to tax; other assets are more difficult to tax.

Asset specificity: The extent to which capital can be moved abroad or not
- Land or oil wells = high specificity, low mobility
- High-level skills or liquid capital = low specificity, high mobility

Political violence should erupt as income inequality and asset specificity increases.

## Ethnic Conflict

"Conventional" wisdom: Primordial cultures, irrational and ancient hatreds, such that given sociocultural heterogeneity, inter-ethnic conflict is a "natural" outcome.

- Hutus vs. Tutsis, Rwanda
- Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, former Yugoslavia
- Africans vs. Arabs, Sudan
- Shias vs. Sunnies vs. Kurds, Iraq
- Jews vs. Palestinians, Israel
- Turks vs. Kurds, Turkey

## Ethno-Linguistic Fractionalisation Index

ELF index is used by social scientists to measure the probability that two individuals selected at random from a given country are NOT members of the same ethnic group.

## Selection Bias and Ethnic Conflict

- Be very cautious of enumerated examples of ethnic conflicts designed to "prove" that ethnic conflicts are ubiquitous and naturally occuring.
- Availability bias: A common cognitive bias in which availability of dramatic events leads naive observers to overestimate probability of analogous events elsewhere or in the immediate future.
- This is a form of selection bias: We over-sample and hence over-estimate the occurrence of certain types of events.

## Frequency vs. Likelihood

- A **list** or **count** of events - i.e. a list of events or of conflicts - it is uninformative about the likelihood of an event occurring.
- The probability of an event is defined as the number of times the event has occurred divided by the *number of times it could have occurred*. Therefore, to *avoid biased reasoning*, you must know the *denominator*.

## Contextualising the Politics of Inter-Ethnic Hostility

- Chewa and Tumbuka: Two Bantu-speaking people of eastern and central Africa.
- Split into citizens of two contemporary nations: Malawi and Zambia
- Border between Malawi and Zambia drawn arbitrarily by colonial authorities.
- Arbitrary border as *natural experiment*: good reason to believe that nothing systematically distinguishes Chewa and Tumbuka on either side of the border, especially in villages right on the border.
- In Malawi, relations are culturally and politically antagonistic. In Zambia, the two groups view each other as ethnic brethren and political allies, with both supporting same political party.

## The Problem with Credible Commitment

- When an actor who makes a promise today has an *incentive to renege* upon it tomorrow
- In the case of civil war termination, both actors have an incentive to renege on any commitment.
- If Party A disarms, Party B can also disarm or it *can take advantage of A's vulnerability* to win a decisive military victory.
- The Prisoner's Dilemma - No incentive to cooperate
- Even though overall it may be rational, on the individual level it is not.

## Ethnic Conflict Solutions - Barbara Walter

- Why are domestic enemies unable to negotiate successfully?
  - And what can the international community do to help these conflicts?
- Four hypotheses:
  - Successful negotiations to end civil wars would vary directly with the strength of *outside security guarantees*.
  - Opponents are increasingly likely to settle as the *expected costs of achieving victory increased*.
  - The *easier the stakes were to divide*, the more likely opponents were to reach a settlement.
  - The *greater the skill of the mediator*, the greater the likelihood for successful settlement.

## In Summary

- Three possible explanations for civil wars
  - Opportunity vs. resources / greed vs. asset-specificity / inequality vs.
  
## Four Forms of External Intervention

1. Ending civil wars
2. Peacekeeping
3. Foreign-imposed regime changes
4. Nation-building

## External Intervention: UN Peacekeeping

Consequences of peacekeeping: There are positive and statistically significant relationships between:
- Presence of UN peacekeepers and lower rates of civilian and combatant deaths
- Peacekeeping missions and the geographic containment of violence, such that violence does not spread within a country or across borders
- Credible promise of peacekeeping mission and signing a peace agreement
- Peacekeeping missions and more durable peace

## External Intervention: Creating the Conditions for Self-Sustaining Peace?

Peacekeeping missions have been much less effective at institutional reforms that would eliminate the underlying structural causes of civil wars: Weak state institutions, weak democracies or autocracies, and extractive economic institutions that do not promote widely-shared prosperity.

## Can Democracy Be Imposed?

States that experience Foreign-Imposed Regime Change initiated by democracies on average gain no significant democratic benefit compared with similar states where democracies did not intervene.


## Nation-Building

A form of foreign intervention, usually during or subsequent to a destructive civil or international war, in which the occupying power attempts to rebuild the basic institutions of a "failed state".
- Strengthen and reform state institutions
- Reconstruct and rebuild economy as a market-based system
- Draft new constitution supporting electoral democracy

Successful American nation-building? Germany and Japan after WWII

Unsuccessful nation-building? Afghanistan and Iraq

## German and Japan as Models for Afghanistan and Iraq

Germany and Japan: Global powers prior to WWII, this is how they were able to start the war!

America reconstructs what was largely there, imposes democracy on institutions, props up domestic forces who were anti-fascists.

What is the institutional landscape all the other places America has tried to nation-build?

## Brownlee on American Nation-Building

Claims about the likelihood of successful nation-building based on the cases of Germany and japan reflect **selection bias**: Selection on very prominent instances of success, neglect of far more numerous cases of failed nation-building.

The probability of successful nation-building is the ratio of the number of successful cases to the total number of cases (successful + failed).

## Why the Persistent Failures?

Sargon the Conqueror: The radius of conquest is larger than the radius of administration

Even modern nation-builders must delegate authority to local agents.

Common outcome: Political concessions made "to the very elites \[Americans] intended to replace and deferred to the societies they meant to transform."

- It is incredibly difficult to completely displace local power structures.
- Think back to where we began: The Military Revolution and *centuries* of external and internal warfare.
- We tend to think of countries as "blank slates" such that once we topple the dictator, we can write a constitution, rebuild schools, and go home.
- Local power holders *always* step into the breach.
- Germany and japan are different precisely because they built powerful centralised states *before* the U.S. occupation began.

## Making Things Worse?

- FIRCs may make civil war more likely through their effects on state infrastructural power.
- Some FIRCs involve the destruction of a state's infrastructural power, both military and civilian bureaucracy.
- The destruction of these assets make insurgency more likely, both because state capacity to deter violence and engage in counter-insurgency is low, and because without a state to provide protection and other goods and services, citizens will transfer loyalty to locally powerful armed organisations.

## The Normative Lesson of Careful Causal Analysis

Nation-building can be justified on strictly normative grounds.

But intervention is a form of causation: Ethical intervention also requires reasons to believe that the intervention will cause normatively desirable outcomes.

Intervention may not be normally justified once the probability of success is taken into account.
