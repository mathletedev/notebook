- What does it mean to be a democracy?
- What is an authoritarian regime?
- What are the variations?
  - How have they evolved over time?
  - Is authoritarianism -> democracy really a linear, one-way process?
  - How may the two be "mixed"?

Identity: class, race, gender, and more
- How are identities constructed?
- How are power structures built?
- How does this affect political outcomes?
  - Power struggles, individual agency, group identity
  - Materialism vs. ideas

Ethnic conflict and civil wars
- Why/How do civil wars occur?
  - Economic interests e.g. seizing differing resources
  - Political culture
- Ethnic conflict
  - What is ethnic conflict, and how may it affect political outcomes?

## Political Culture Theory

Emphasis on consensus over conflict. Shared values and beliefs that form a common citizenry are reflected in the political system.
*Politics as from the "bottom up"*
Shared beliefs and values of the people at large that create political systems. NOT the actions of political elites or other types of elites.
Therefore, theories of political culture tend to make specific claims about preferences, while rejecting claims about power.

Counterargument: Greek and Roman culture didn't change a lot, but they went from democracy back to authoritarianism.

Political culture is a **framework theory** because it draws from many different areas.

## What is Civic Culture?

A cluster of attitudes that includes:
- The belief on the part of the individuals that they can influence political decisions
- Positive feelings towards the political system
- High levels of interpersonal trust
- Preferences for gradual societal change

**Civic**: Participation in one's local community and/or government.

*Civic culture is necessary for a stable democracy.*

## Putnam

### Civic Traditions in Modern Italy

> *Key Question*
> Why are regional governments in the north of Italy more effective than regional governments in the south?

- Northern Italy: Strong civic culture
- More active civil society -> norm of citizens taking part in politics and social events within their broader community
- Value of social networks: Emphasis on reciprocity and social cooperation

What makes a successful democracy?
- A strong level of mutual trust amongst citizens

### Bowling Alone

Focus on the decline of social networks, especially in the United States.
- Decline of unions, religious groups, Boy/Girl Scout volunteers, parent-teacher associations, Freemasonry, etc.

People used to go to bowling leagues to bowl, now people bowl alone. People in urban areas tend to socialise less, whereas people in rural areas are more likely to hang out with neighbours, friends, etc.

Negative consequences for American democracy:
- Decreased voter turnout
- Decreased work/membership with political parties
- Growing distrust amongst citizens and distrust for politicians (we can't be constantly worried about everything)

## Inglehart

### Values and Democratic Stability

Broad conceptualisation of civic culture:
- A coherent set of personal life satisfaction, political satisfaction, interpersonal trust, and support for the existing social order
- Countries that rank highly according to these elements are much likelier to be stable democracies

Operationalisation and measurement:
- To what extent are people in *industrial countries* satisfied with life?
- Italy has very low "Very Satisfied" percentage (following Putnam's argument)
- Denmark has very high percentage
- Earlier democratic institutions are correlated with higher mean satisfaction with life

Possible outside variable:
**Economic change** -> cultural change -> stable democracy
Industrialisation -> shift from traditional to secular-rational values -> civic culture

Role of technology and economic growth:
- People have more autonomy over their lives
- More resources and time
  - If you don't have to worry about starving anymore, you can think more about the world
- Concerns shift

Shift to personal/individual autonomy
- Move away from all-encompassing religious doctrines that apply to everyone
- Respect for difference, right to live life as they please (within limits)
- Self-expression
- Questioning of authorities, hierarchies, dogmatism
- This is **secular-rational**
- This is **civic culture**

Higher GNP (gross national product) per capita = Higher life satisfaction & interpersonal trust
