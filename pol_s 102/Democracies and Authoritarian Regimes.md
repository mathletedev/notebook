## Political Culture Theory

Emphasis on consensus over conflict. Shared values and beliefs that form a common citizenry are reflected in the political system.
*Politics as from the "bottom up"*
Shared beliefs and values of the people at large that create political systems. NOT the actions of political elites or other types of elites.
Therefore, theories of political culture tend to make specific claims about preferences, while rejecting claims about power.

Counterargument: Greek and Roman culture didn't change a lot, but they went from democracy back to authoritarianism.

Political culture is a **framework theory** because it draws from many different areas.

## What is Civic Culture?

A cluster of attitudes that includes:
- The belief on the part of the individuals that they can influence political decisions
- Positive feelings towards the political system
- High levels of interpersonal trust
- Preferences for gradual societal change

**Civic**: Participation in one's local community and/or government.

*Civic culture is necessary for a stable democracy.*
