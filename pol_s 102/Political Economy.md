Two different types of theories about political outcomes:
- Political culture
- Political institutions
  - Electoral systems
  - Presidential vs. parliamentary systems
  - Political parties

## Key Debates/Ideas About Political Economy

Laissez-faire?

- Economic development affects political outcomes
- **Classic Modernisation Theory**
  - Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
  - Democracies are more likely to **emerge** as countries become more developed
- The "Survival Story"
  - Societies pass through the same stages of economic development
  - Democracies are more likely to **survive** as countries become more developed

## Classic Modernisation Theory

Previously, we had peasants, aristocracy, and monarchs.
Now, no longer have landed aristocracy -> society is more complex (more economic sectors). Authoritarian government can't keep up.

*Economic development promotes democratisation.*
As GDP per capita increases, likelihood of democracy increases.

Counterarguments:
- Democracy might be the cause of economic success, not the other way around
- [[Religion and Democracy|Political culture]] may influence both variables

## The "Survival Story"

Economic development helps democracies **survive** but does not necessarily help them **emerge**.

If economy is good, individuals are content, so they don't want to take the chance at overthrowing democracy.
If economy is bad, individuals have a better chance at overthrowing democracy to be "better off", resulting in a dictatorship.

### Differences

Modernisation Theory:
- Transitions to democracy become more likely as income increases
- Regime transitions may or may not become less likely as countries become richer

Survival Story:
- Transitions to democracy are unaffected by increases in income
- Regime transitions become less likely as countries become richer

### The Evidence

Data does not support Survival Story. (This doesn't mean Modernisation Theory is correct)

## Variants of Modernisation Theory

Classical Modernisation Theory lacks a central causal mechanism

Four variants
1. Structural changes
2. Natural resources
  - **Resource curse**: Countries with a lot of natural resources are prone to corruption and foreign influence.
    - State can generate wealth independent from its citizens
3. Foreign aid
  - Again, government receives support from someone other than its own citizens
4. Inequality
