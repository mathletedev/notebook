## Causal Heterogeneity

- Transitions in one part of the world may prelude parallel transitions in other parts of the world at other points in time.
  - The conditions that produced European political and economic power were unique and largely non-replicable
  - Once Europe emerges as a global hegemon
- Theories of development must be historically specific: The role of the state in the transition to capitalism in Europe was different from the role of the state in late development.

## Three Questions About Transitions to Democracy

1. What explains the transitions to mass-participatory politics that occurred prior to the emergence of the first democracies?
2. What explains the initial origins of democracy in specific global regions in the nineteenth century?
3. What explains the subsequent incremental and discontinuous spread of democracy around the globe in the twentieth century?

Hypotheses:
- Need for institutions to fund military
  - No taxation without representation
- French Revolution influenced lower-class rising
- Bargaining vs. predation argument

### Our Initial Hunch

The rise of modern bureaucratic state and the subsequent emergence of capitalism both contributed to mass potilics and the initial origins of capitalism.

The uneven distribution of state power around the globe and the uneven capacity of wealth production that follows explains the incremental and discontinuous spread of democracy around the globe in the twentieth century.

### A Possible Causal Map of the Initial Transition to Democracy

Modern state -> capitalism or nationalism -> social movements -> democratic transitions

## Nations and Nationalism

- We live in a world populated by groups of people who define their common identity with respect to a state - roughly speaking, "nations"
- A central political idea over the past 150-200 years is the claim that the borders of the nation and the borders of the state should be congruent.
- This idea shapes our identities: We define ourselves as citizens of the nation to which we belong.
  - E.g. Roman Empire - citizens didn't really "belong"
- We attach the rights and obligations of citizenship to members of the nation and deny them to non-members.

## Three Common Claims About Nations and Nationalism

- Nations exist from time immemorial - rooted in "primordial" identities
- Ancient national cultures were relatively homogeneous
- Ancient national cultures were linguistically uniform

### Why These Claims are Myths

- Pre-modern European polities were hierarchically stratified with heterogeneous rights and obligations attached to each of three orders (nobility, clergy, burghers).
  - This type of heterogeneity was common in systems of indirect rule and would persist around the world until the French Revolution initiated the age of citizenship and republics.
- Legal/administrative heterogeneity was accompanied by cultural heterogeneity.
- Linguistic diversity: Liturgical and court languages, localised vernaculars.
- Rulers had neither the desire nor the capacity to elicit cultural uniformity.
- Rulers claimed divine right to rule, not mass-based legitimacy.

### Why Do These Myths Matter?

- The myths, were they true, would be sufficient to establish the **exogeneity** of cultural identities and would even suggest that cultural identities shape politics and perhaps even economics.
- If the myths are not true, then cultural identities must have changed over time; and is quite likely that they are **endogenous** to something else.
- They could be endogenous to economic change and the rise of capitalism.
- They could also be endogenous to the rise of the modern state.

## The Problem of Asymmetric Information (Again)

Rulers wish to extract wealth and manpower, but they do not know how much of these resources exist and who controls them.

Rulers dispatch agents to the local level:
- Even local agents have difficulty gaining access to local information

## Origins of European Nationalism: Legibility

- Alongside of plunder and bargaining, European states worked hard to render their societies more **legible**: Gain access o more information.
- Pre-modern societies were highly **particularistic** - based on local languages, local practices, local units of measure - and hence illegible to outsiders.
- Local particularism insulates communities from state power.
- Projects of legibility: *create standardised categories and measures and apply uniformly to entire population*: Reduce the costs of acquiring information.
- Standardisation and legibility would have been unthinkable to rulers with low infrastructural power: Would not have had the capacity.
