## Arab Spring

Mohamed Bouazizi of Tunisia set himself on fire (*self-immolation*) to protest against local officials harassing him with no reason. Protests spread from his hometown to Tunis (capital of Tunisia). Forced President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali to flee.

More self-immolation protests in Egypt and Algeria, and across Middle East and North Africa. Organised through social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak resigned and found guilty of corruption. Protests aided by NATO air strikes. By March 2011, significant protests occurred in 17 countries throughout Middle East and North Africa.

## Spring of Nations

Beginning with revolt in Sicily in January 1848, nearly 50 revolts across Europe against decade-long dynasties. France, Austria, Prussia, Germany, Italy.

Causes:
- Rapid changes in social structure
- Industrial Revolution gave middle-class power
- Working-class groups

Optimism and hope that government would be controlled by the people. However, most of these revolutions failed. **Revolution is followed by reaction.**

Comparative politics tries to explain why Arab Spring didn't result in wave of democracy. Most countries' government remained stagnant. Possible argument that authoritarian regimes had **oil wealth and hereditary rule** to withstand uprisings.

*Each generation has a complex and urgent reason for studying comparative politics.*

> **Comparative politics** is the study of political phenomena that occur predominantly within countries. **International politics** is the study of political phenomena that occur predominantly between countries.

## Aftermath

Economic instability went from Middle East to industrial countries again, forcing scholars to revisit. Maybe capitalism can lessen the problem.

*Societal order in large groups is something that needs to be explained, rather than assumed.*
