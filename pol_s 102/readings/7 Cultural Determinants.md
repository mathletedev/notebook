> Cultural differences drive significant elements of political and economic life.

Two cultural arguments categories:
**Primordialist**: Culture is objective and inherited--it's fixed since "primordial" times. Culture shapes political behaviour rather than vice versa. Therefore, political institutions such as democracy may not be compatible with all cultures.
**Constructivist**: Culture is malleable--it changes in response to social, economic, and political actors. Therefore, cultures are not impenetrable barriers to democratisation, but some cultures will find it easier to adopt democracy than others.

## Classical Cultural Arguments: Mill and Montesquieu

> *Example: Aeschylus's Play,* The Persians *(472BC)*
> Distinguished East and West, associated East with despotism, West with democracy. Democracy seen in Athenian Greece. Later addressed in the Asian values debate in the 1990s.

> *Example: Montesquieu,* The Spirit of the Laws *(1748)*
> Divided political institutions into monarchies, despotisms, and republics (democracies). First person to write in any great detail about importance of culture to political institutions. Believed best government "leads men by following their propensities and inclinations". 
> Political institutions are shaped by a country's native factors (religion, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, customs). Very difficult to export political institutions from one country to another.

> *Example: John Stuart Mill,* Representative Government *(1861)*
> One person can't do everything, so representative government is needed.
> Also echoed Montesquieu's argument, e.g. how Native American Indians wouldn't have a civilised government without outside influence.
> However, Mill believed that culture shouldn't prevent institutions. Familiarity helps, but it's possible to make a strange thing familiar. Need to take account of "preexisting habits and feelings" when creating political institutions.
> *The above argument is not falsifiable.*

These arguments are vague and nonscientific, since they don't specify *exactly* what about culture matters. Also hard to discern exact casual relationship between culture, economic development, and democracy.

## Does Democracy Require a Civic Culture?

> *Example: Gabriel Almod and Sidney Verba,* The Civic Culture
> Three basic types of political culture: parochial, subject, and participant/civic. Only civic culture is compatible with democracy.
> Civic culture reflects a particular cluster of attitudes that includes: belief that individuals can influence political decisions, positive feelings towards the political system, high levels of interpersonal trust, and preferences for gradual societal change. Parochial and subject political cultures reflect different clusters of attitudes.
> Germany, Italy, Mexico, U.S., and U.K. were the most stable democracies and most closely resembled ideal civic culture. Therefore, civic culture is necessary for democratic stability.

Inglehart also reached a similar conclusion.

### Dimensions of Cross-Cultural Variation

First dimension:
**Traditional values**: Emphasise importance of religion, traditional family roles, and deference to authority. Exhibit national pride and reject divorce, euthanasia, suicide, and abortion.
**Secular-rational values**: Less emphasis on traditional values. Find the latter more acceptable.

Second dimension:
**Survival values**: Emphasise importance of physical and economic security. Ethnocentric world-view and exhibit low levels of interpersonal trust and tolerance.
**Self-expression values**: Emphasise importance of gender, racial, and sexual equality; environmental protection; tolerance of diversity; civic activism; and life satisfaction. Exhibit high levels of interpersonal trust and demand greater say in political and economic decisions.

Examples:
**Traditional & survival**: Jordan, Yemen, Morocco
**Traditional & self-expression**: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador
**Secular & survival**: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine
**Secular & self-expression**: Sweden, Norway, Denmark

Two phases to modernisation:
**Industrialisation phase**: Shift away from traditional values to secular-rational values. Technology results in more control over the environment, causing a decline in the importance of religion. Essentially a secularisation process.
**Post-industrialisation phase**: Shift away from survival values to self-expression values. Need for physical and economic security results in wealthier societies. More opportunities for self-expression and personal autonomy. Liberalisation and democratisation.

### Causal Relationship

**Cultural modernisation theory** (Inglehart and Welzel):
Economic development -> cultural change -> democracy

**Institutional story** (Barry, Mull, Seligson):
Economic development -> democracy -> cultural change

Perhaps these two stories work together to create a cycle.

## Surveys and Comparative Research

It is difficult to judge the accuracy of surveys. Respondents may have reasons to lie or conceal their true beliefs. This is especially true with sensitive topics (democracy in an authoritarian regime) or negative attitudes that run counter to social norms.

> *Social desirability bias*
> Where individuals tend to over-report "good behaviour" and under-report "bad behaviour". E.g. underestimate support for extremist anti-immigrant parties in Europe or overestimate support for minority political candidates in the U.S.

If citizens in authoritarian societies under-report enthusiasm for democracy for fear of punishment, then we might believe in a positive association between attitudes towards democracy and democratic persistence.

Topics are also sometimes weighed on different scales by different people who have different definitions. This can cause the results of surveys to be misleading.

> *Differential item functioning (DIF)*
> Different items may function differently across individuals or groups. DIF exists when individuals or groups understand survey items differently or evaluate survey items using different scales.

### Methods for Addressing Survey Problems

#### Survey Administration

Individuals feel more comfortable and are more trusting towards interviewers who share similar demographic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity). They are also more truthful when they report answers in private.

#### Randomised Response Techniques

Introduce uncertainty into individuals' responses.
E.g. when a die rolls
- 1: Answer "yes"
- 6: Answer "no"
- 2, 3, 4, 5: Answer truthfully
Then, at the end, the researchers deduce the actual statistics.

#### List Experiments

Provide a list of items and only individuals how many they agree with. Have a control and experimental group, and only introduce the sensitive item in the experimental group.

#### Endorsement Experiments

Mix plain policies and political actors endorsing said policies. Comparing results against a control that didn't hear political actors isolates opinions about the political actors.

#### Anchoring Vignettes

Provide a short story from an individual about a particular issue, then ask the respondents to compare their own experiences to the former. This sets a common reference point and alleviates DIF.

## Religion and Democracy

Historically, believed that Protestantism encourages democracy but Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity, Islam, and Confucianism inhibit it.
First instance: Max Weber in his book *The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism*
Protestantism encourages economic development and is one element of Inglehart's civic culture.

Rodney Stark emphasises that Christianity in general focuses on orthodoxy (correct belief) rather than Islam's and Judaism's orthopraxy (correct practice).

Woodberry and Shah argue that Protestants' missionary activity influenced many countries towards democracy.

Lipset argues that Catholicism runs counter to democracy since it emphasises one church and one truth, while democracy tends to accept different and competing ideologies. Also, Catholic Church has a hierarchy and distinction between clergy and laity.

Huntington argues that Western concepts differ fundamentally from religions from other areas. Confucian democracy is a contradiction, Asian values debate pointed out Confucianism emphasises respect for authority, communalism, and consensus. Used to justify nondemocratic forms of government by authoritarian leaders in Asia.

Islam is undemocratic for "in Islam God is Caesar". Also has unequal treatment of women--men hold attitudes that are more conducive to domination and thus susceptible to dicatorship.

Przeworski and colleagues argue that Protestantism has economic inequality and individual self-interest, which run counter to democracy.

Some Confucian governments have worked, such as Joseon dynasty in Korea from 1392 to 1910. Confucianism does not require an authoritarian government. Friedman even suggests that "Buddhist and Confucian cultures may actually have more democratic elements than Greco-Christian culture."

Islam also has principles of democracy: *shura* (consultation), *ijma* (consensus of community), *ijtihad* (reinterpretation), *maslaha* (public welfare). Although, in practice, the state has sovereignty and not God in Islam. However, both Islam and democracy share the same goal of limited government.

## Some Empirical Evidence

All religions can be interpreted in various ways to justify different types of government. Lots of empirical evidence undermines Huntington's argument that religions and civilisations are stagnant.

Secular elites have controlled political power in Islamic countries. Being Muslim does not mean one cannot live in a democratic society.

**Constitution of Medina**: Prophet Muhammad went to Medina, a highly diverse city of non-Muslim Arabs, Jews, and Muslims. Muhammad had the people sign a constitution. A real-world example of a social contract that Hobbes and Rousseau talked about. First historical document to establish religious freedom as a fundamental constitutional right. Religious pluralism.

Islamic countries seem to have lower Freedom House scores than non-Islamic countries. Inference that poor treatment of women (high literacy gap, fewer in government) leads to low democracy scores.

Free vs. non-free rates of Catholic countries changed from 1976 (majority non-free) to 2004 (majority free). *Therefore, we shouldn't draw strong inferences between religion, civilisation, and democracy from a single point in time.* Turns out, most arguments draw from a particular point in time.

## Are Some Religions Incompatible with Democracy? A New Test

Cultural and ethnic diversity may be bad for democracy. Coordination of beliefs is considered "democratic culture", and ethnic diversity increases the risk of inter-communal violence.

Hypotheses:
*Catholic hypothesis*: Countries that are majority Catholic are less likely to become and stay democratic.
*Protestant hypothesis*: Protestant = more likely
*Islamic hypothesis*: Islamic = less likely
*Ethnic group hypothesis*: Large number of ethnic groups = less likely
*Religious group hypothesis*: Large number of religious groups = less likely
*Cultural group hypothesis*: Large number of cultural groups = less likely

### The Evidence (Table 7.2)

Emergence of democracy:
- Islam is negatively associated, but it is more likely that this is because Muslim countries tend to be poorer.
- Protestantism is not statistically significant.
- Catholicism is positively associated (counter to Huntington's claim).
- Ethnic, religious, and cultural diversity are not statistically significant.

Democratic survival:
- Protestantism is strongly positively associated (however, could be because of wealth).
- Islam is negatively associated (however, probably due to being poor).
- Catholicism is not statistically significant.
- Ethnic and cultural diversity are negatively associated.
- Religious diversity is not statistically significant.

Interesting note: Economic growth is good for both dictatorships and democracies.

## Experiments and Culture

### Ultimatum and Dictator Games

There is a "proposer" and "responder", and a "pie" (usually money, let's say $100).
**Ultimatum Game**: Proposer offers a portion of the pie (e.g. $40). Responder can either accept or reject the offer. If reject, neither party receives any money.
**Dictator Game**: Proposer offers a portion of the pie. Reponder cannot reject.

**Homo economicus**: Individuals who care only about their own share of the pie.

Ultimatum Game has two dimensions: Fairness and fear of rejection. Dictator game only has fairness.

Student populations playing the Ultimatum Game usually had offers around 50%, somewhere between 40%-45%. Modal offer for Dictator Game was $0, showing that Ultimatum Game is mostly fear of rejection. However, the mean for Dictator Game is still 20%-30%, showing some sense of fairness. This is called **prosocial behaviour**.

Researchers ranked cultural groups along two dimensions: payoffs to cooperation and market integration.
**Payoffs to cooperation**: How important it is to cooperate with non-immediate kin in economic production
**Market integration**: How much the groups relied on market exchange in their everyday lives

Higher values in both dimensions were associated with higher mean offers in the Ultimatum Game. 68 percent of the variance in offers could be explained by these two variables alone.

*Societies that require cooperation, competition, and compromise find it easier to adopt and support democratic institutions.*
