> Cultural differences drive significant elements of political and economic life.

Two cultural arguments categories:
**Primordialist**: Culture is objective and inherited--it's fixed since "primordial" times. Culture shapes political behaviour rather than vice versa. Therefore, political institutions such as democracy may not be compatible with all cultures.
**Constructivist**: Culture is malleable--it changes in response to social, economic, and political actors. Therefore, cultures are not impenetrable barriers to democratisation, but some cultures will find it easier to adopt democracy than others.

## Classical Cultural Arguments: Mill and Montesquieu

> *Example: Aeschylus's Play,* The Persians
> Associated people of Asia with democracy found in Athenian Greece. Later known as the Asian values debate in the 1990s.

> *Example: Montesquieu*
> First person to write in any great detail about importance of culture to political institutions. Believed best government "leads men by following their propensities and inclinations". 
> Political institutions are shaped by a country's native factors (religion, riches, numbers, commerce, manners, customs). Very difficult to export political institutions from one country to another.

John Stuart Mill also echoed Montesquieu's argument, e.g. how Native American Indians wouldn't have a civilised government without outside influence. However, Mill believed that culture shouldn't prevent institutions. Familiarity helps, but it's possible to make a strange thing familiar.

These arguments are vague and nonscientific, since they don't specify *exactly* what about culture matters. Also hard to discern exact casual relationship between culture, economic development, and democracy.

## Does Democracy Require a Civic Culture?

> *Example: Gabriel Almod and Sidney Verba,* The Civic Culture
> Three basic types of political culture: parochial, subject, and participant/civic. Only civic culture is compatible with democracy.
> Civic culture reflects a particular cluster of attitudes that includes: belief that individuals can influence political decisions, positive feelings toward the political system, high levels of interpersonal trust, and preferences for gradual societal change. Parochial and subject political cultures reflect different clusters of attitudes.
> Germany, Italy, Mexico, U.S., and U.K. were the most stable democracies and most closely resembled ideal civic culture. Therefore, civic culture is necessary for democratic stability.

Inglehart also reached a similar conclusion.

### Dimensions of Cross-Cultural Variation

First dimension:
**Traditional values**: Emphasise importance of religion, traditional family roles, and deference to authority. Exhibit national pride and reject divorce, euthanasia, suicide, and abortion.
**Secular-rational values**: Less emphasis on traditional values. Find the latter more acceptable.

Second dimension:
**Survival values**: Emphasise importance of physical and economic security. Ethnocentric world-view and exhibit low levels of interpersonal trust and tolerance.
**Self-expression values**: Emphasise importance of gender, racial, and sexual equality; environmental protection; tolerance of diversity; civic activism; and life satisfaction. Exhibit high levels of interpersonal trust and demand greater say in political and economic decisions.

Examples:
**Traditional & survival**: Jordan, Yemen, Morocco
**Traditional & self-expression**: Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador
**Secular & survival**: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine
**Secular & self-expression**: Sweden, Norway, Denmark

Two phases to modernisation:
**Industrialisation phase**: Shift away from traditional values to secular-rational values. Technology results in more control over the environment, causing a decline in the importance of religion. Essentially a secularisation process.
