## State Capacity

- Ability of the state to achieve its objectives, even against the resistance of non-state actors
- State capacity varies along two dimensions: despotic power and infrastructural power (Mann, *Sources of Social Power*).
  - Despotic power: Power to make decisions without consultation from non-state actors
  - Infrastructural power: The capacity for the state to implement its decisions and elicit compliance from the population

## Why do Post-Colonial States Differ?

European state formation was a fight for survival in which most died.

Outside of Europe, it was Europeans who supervised the creation of modern states.

The rest of the world cannot simply duplicate the European experience. Modern European state is organically created.

Conflict:
- European rulers created institutions everywhere they went: These states felt like they "leapfrogged" to well-structured states
- However, new states had no military or commercial revolution

Rivalries create incentive for high taxation.

European system was influential enough to prevent conflict between Latin American states.

## Global Economic Consequences of Initial State Formation: External Predation

- Military conquest of wealth: Precious metals and spices.
- Production of lucrative crops (tobacco, cotton, sugar, coffee) using enslaved human beings as labour.
- With onset of industrial revolution: Control over territory as source of raw material for industry and as market for manufactured products

Only interested in resources of areas, so no reason to create a formal state.

## Global Political Consequences of Initial State Formation

- Destruction of local, pre-modern political institutions
- Creation of imperial political structure: Increasingly modern institutions (bureaucracy and military) that brutally exclude local populations
- Colonial legacy: Facade of modern state institutions
  - Cannot simply 

## Post-Colonial States

- Cannot replicate European pattern of state building
  - European political hegemony largely preempts war-induced state building
  - European economic hegemony largely preempts local commercial and industrial revolutions

## Consequences for Post-Colonial Infrastructural Power

On average, post-colonial states (in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia) exercise *substantially lower levels of infrastructural power*, relative to states in Western Europe and settler-colonial states.

## How do Weak Post-Colonial States Survive?

- The Same global dynamics that preempt potential emergence of powerful post-colonial states also intervenes to sustain weak states.
- Given international system, there is no selection mechanism to remove weaker states.
  - International norms of sovereignty dictate intervention to prevent military conquest and consolidation
  - International donors and lenders
  - Sale of natural resources
  - International military assistance

*No incentive for local ruler to address local population if there are resources elsewhere.*

## Dynamics of Weak States

- Induced dysfunctional dynamic: Because post-colonial states rely for resources on international system, rulers have reduced need to bargain with population and to build stronger institutions
- Reduced incentives for principals to hold agents accountable
- Result: High levels of corruption and weak states

*If you're already in power, you don't need to get resources from citizenry; instead, just pay to keep opposition away from you.*

National system has incentive to maintain stability, even it it means accepting dictators.

If you are a strong state that depends on the resources of a weak state, you don't want that weak state to be in a war.

## Punctuated Equilibria

From our brief historical overview, we can observe two types of historical periods: Periods of rapid institutional change (critical junctures) and longer periods of relatively stable equilibria (characterised by path dependency).
- Pre-Neolithic revolution disrupted by climate change
- Neolithic revolution: Millennia of semi-sedentary agriculture
- Urban revolution made possible by alluvial agriculture
- Political revolution: Emergence of territorially extensive empires but weak states
- Rise of the modern state, made possible by military revolution (or perhaps by Protestant Reformation or commercial/capitalist revolution)

## Recap: States and Public Goods

- States can compel compliance and punish free-riding
  - E.g. clean air: You can't force someone to not breathe air
- States can supply public goods more efficiently because of economies of scale
- The efficient provision of public goods like the protection of private property require high levels of infrastructural power to finance the state and to spend its revenues.
  - States with high agency loss cannot provide public goods (or cannot provide them efficiently)

## A Possible Model of State Capacity and Wealth

Infrastructural power -> inclusive or extractive economic institutions -> levels of wealth

- Acemoglu & Robinson: Inclusive economic institutions depend upon inclusive political institutions (political pluralism and centralised state)
- Weber: Rise of modern state and elimination of pre-capitalist obstacles to capitalism
- Dincecco: Growth of state capacity, growth of tax revenue, growth of wealth

### Adapting this Model for the Post-Colonial World

Given inherited legacy of weak states and extractive economic institutions:

Predatory intermediate or developmental states -> inclusive or extractive economic institutions -> levels of wealth

- Acemoglu & Robinson: Inherited legacies
- Evans: Types of states and development
- Kohli: Sources of variation in post-colonial states

## Predictions

1. There will not be a direct replication of the European experience because once Europe conquers the globe, the conditions of development have changed.
2. Long-term historical legacies of colonial/imperial rule and extractive institutions will have an observable causal effect on contemporary political institutions and levels of wealth.
3. Variations in contemporary national income can be traced to variations in state capacity.

## Europe Conquers the Global Economy

- Large-scale transfer of wealth to small number of European economies
- Primary instrument was force

## Did Europe Become Wealthy Because of the Transfer of Wealth?

Diverse relationships between global extraction of wealth and local institutional innovation:
- England & France: Wealth extraction and institutional innovation; early growth trajectory
- Germany, Austria, Sweden, Denmark: Institutional innovation without major sources of external wealth extraction; early growth trajectory
- Spain& Portugal: Wealth extraction without institutional innovation: Long-term, low-growth trajectory
- Italy: No wealth extraction, limited institutional innovation: Long-term, low-growth trajectory

## Were Polites in Asia, Africa, and Latin America on the Cusp of State Formation & Capitalist Development?

There is *nothing* culturally unique about Europe that explains long-term development.

The pairing of exclusive political institutions and extractive economic institutions 

In Europe, that equilibrium was disrupted by the convergence of a commercial and military revolution in a region without a single imperial power.

There is no direct evidence of any parallel disruption of the self-reinforcing equilibrium outside of Europe, but *once Europeans intervene, we are prevented from observing the counterfactual.*

## The Economic Legacy of Colonialism in the 20th Century

Global division of labour in which:
- Economies in the industrial **core** - primarily in Western Europe and North America - dominate production of manufactured goods.
- Economies in the **periphery**

### Haiti

- 700,000 indigenous people reduced to 100
- Enslaved labourers exploited from 1500s onwards
- Independence revolts from 1791 to 1804
- Struggles post-independence:
  - How to re-activate the economy?
- Authoritarian nature: Reinforced hierarchy of military
- Indemnity payments to France (1825) - dependency ($20 billion in today's dollars)
