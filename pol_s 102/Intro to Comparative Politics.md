## Normative vs. Aesthetic Claims

**Normative claims** are based on bias or opinion.
**Subjective claims** cannot be true or false. E.g. "Star Wars sequels are better than the original."

## Confirmation Bias

**Confirmation bias** means we see what we want to see. The brain cannot process all apparent information at once. You have to be mindful and conscious about what you take in.

*We are prone to systematic errors in the way that we see the world.* This is due to features of our cognitive systems. We underestimate the uncertainty of our knowledge (we can't live in uncertainly).

We can't all be experts on everything, so we **delegate authority** to other humans.
*Therefore, the primary principle of studying politics is to falsify hypotheses.*

Our belief in the credibility of our claims should be exclusively based on the credibility of the **methods** used to produce them. Trust the experts, not because they know their things, but because they use the correct methods.

> *Example*
> Some believe the increase in graduation requirements caused the decrease in risky teen behaviour.

These events are unrelated, so you would need more data to understand this claim, e.g. data from schools that did not increase graduation requirements.

## Course Overview

### What is CP?

#### What it is NOT

- Reviewing countries one-by-one
  - There is value in a single case study, but our goal here is to remain broad and open-minded
  - You'll have the opportunity to be more focused in your country-case assignments

#### What is is

  - Comparison (and contrast) of countries' domestic political affairs
  - In the U.S. context: traditionally everything outside of the U.S.

### Three Theories

Three broad theories of viewing:
- Political culture
- Political institutions
- Political economy

At the broadest level:
- Culture is associated with political outcomes.
- Institutions are associated with political outcomes.
- Economic interests are associated with political outcomes.

The world is messy:
- Usually a mix of things going on
- But we want our explanations to be coherent and try to accurately describe what's happening

### Political culture

Norms, values, beliefs, religion, etc. affect political outcomes.

> *Example: Robert Dahl and Democracy*
> The United Kingdom developed a norm of "agreeing to disagree" which has been especially conducive to democratic politics.

> *Example: Weber and the Protestant Ethic*
> Countries with protestant values tend to be well-organised and ambitious.

### Political Institutions

- Presidential vs. parliamentary systems

> *Example: Juan Linz*
> Presidentialism associated with democratic breakdown, dictatorship.

- Electoral systems
  - Majoritarian vs. proportional representation
  - Accountable vs. representative politics
- Political parties
  - How many? Size of political parties?
  - Well-organised?

### Political Economy

> *Example: Arab Spring*
> Unemployment causes propensity to protest. Arab Spring had better educated population with no jobs.

### State Formation

- The nation state and borders are not self-evident
  - Origins? Why do we have nation states? Where did they come from?
  - Begin by looking at Europe
    - Various kingdoms, highly decentralised
    - Over time, more centralised
  - Post-colonial states
    - Did not follow the same trajectory
      - "Stunted growth" as a result of "Europe getting there first"

### Social Movements and Protest Politics

- Why form social movements?
  - Goals?
  - How cohesive and successful are they?
  - Why do people protest, and when?
