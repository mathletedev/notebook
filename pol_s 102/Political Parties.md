## Two-Party Systems vs. Multiparty Systems

- Tightly connected to parliamentary/presidential systems
- AND electoral systems

*A third party can throw off the votes.*

## Defining a Political Party

- Group of (somewhat) like-minded individuals who want to attain formal political power in office
  - Distinguish to informal power: e.g. a social movement, a protest group
  - Also distinguished from interest groups
- Therefore, political parties are a form of professionalisation
  - Turn citizens into political elites who know the ins-and-outs of policy proposals, policy making, and so on
- Provide links between rulers and the ruled: the political elites and citizens
- Invaluable for healthy democracies

*Ambitious political candidates have no reason to build organisations that benefit other candidates.*

The government usually has to step in to provide public goods, because the incentive for private individual to provide those public goods is low.

Also known as the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem). Why do something yourself if someone else can do it and you will still benefit?

## The Importance of Political Parties

- Organising people and ideas
- Driver of political participation
  - European context - party membership usually much higher
- A big say in determining the policy agenda
- In the European context, even small parties can have a big impact
  - The "permissiveness" of electoral systems in most European countries
  - Proportional representation

## Themes for Consideration

- What drives formation and success of political parties?
- Two approaches:
  - Bottom-up: social cleavages, changes/dynamics within citizens and the electorate
  - Top-down:
    1. Party strategy and party elites shaping success, selling their party to the masses strategically altering party positions and platform to gain favour (and ultimately, votes)
    2. Institutions (electoral institutions and laws primarily)
      - Incentives differ from electoral system to electoral system
        - Can new parties break through? Or work within the current system?
- Variations in organisation of parties and party systems:
  - Coalition-building
    - Multiparty systems: parties will probably have to make compromises
    - Two-party systems: debate / "coalition building" goes on BEFORE running for office (e.g. primaries)
      - Although this can actually weaken parties - direct appeals from one person to the electorate (Linz and Perils of Presidentialism)

> *Key Question*
> Do institutions or social cleavages matter more for political party formation and success?
