## Two-Party Systems vs. Multiparty Systems

- Tightly connected to parliamentary/presidential systems
- AND electoral systems

*A third party can throw off the votes.*

## Defining a Political Party

- Group of (somewhat) like-minded individuals who want to attain formal political power in office
  - Distinguish to informal power: e.g. a social movement, a protest group
  - Also distinguished from interest groups
- Therefore, political parties are a form of professionalisation
  - Turn citizens into political elites who know the ins-and-outs of policy proposals, policy making, and so on
- Provide links between rulers and the ruled: the political elites and citizens
- Invaluable for healthy democracies

*Ambitious political candidates have no reason to build organisations that benefit other candidates.*

The government usually has to step in to provide public goods, because the incentive for private individual to provide those public goods is low.

Also known as the [free-rider problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem). Why do something yourself if someone else can do it and you will still benefit?

## The Importance of Political Parties

- Organising people and ideas
- Driver of political participation
  - European context - party membership usually much higher
- A big say in determining the policy agenda
- In the European context, even small parties can have a big impact
  - The "permissiveness" of electoral systems in most European countries
  - Proportional representation

## Themes for Consideration

- What drives formation and success of political parties?
- Two approaches:
  - Bottom-up: social cleavages, changes/dynamics within citizens and the electorate
  - Top-down:
    1. Party strategy and party elites shaping success, selling their party to the masses strategically altering party positions and platform to gain favour (and ultimately, votes)
    2. Institutions (electoral institutions and laws primarily)
      - Incentives differ from electoral system to electoral system
        - Can new parties break through? Or work within the current system?
- Variations in organisation of parties and party systems:
  - Coalition-building
    - Multiparty systems: parties will probably have to make compromises
    - Two-party systems: debate / "coalition building" goes on BEFORE running for office (e.g. primaries)
      - Although this can actually weaken parties - direct appeals from one person to the electorate (Linz and Perils of Presidentialism)

> *Key Question*
> Do institutions or social cleavages matter more for political party formation and success?

## Defining "Party System"

Most common:
- Two-party systems
  - Only two parties have a realistic chance
  - US as a classic example
  - Also UK, but some variation
  - Tightly linked to type of electoral system: majoritarian/plurality focused
- Multiparty systems
  - Multiple parties have a realistic chance of holding power
  - Most democracies have multiparty systems
  - Coalition building

Less common:
- Non-partisan system
  - Small islands such as Micronesia and Tuvalu
  - Absence of political parties
  - Unicameral legislature of Nebraska
- Single-party system
  - Only one party allowed to hold power (so authoritarian)
    - China, Cuba, North Korea, Vietnam
- One party dominant system
  - In theory, multiple parties exist but only one has a realistic chance of power
  - Common in authoritarian regimes
  - But also, Japan and Liberal Party 1955-1993

### Effective Number of Parties as a Measure of Party System

$$ \text{effective number of parties} = \dfrac{1}{\sum_{i = 0}^N {p_i}^2} $$

Where $p_i$ is the proportion of votes a certain party receives, whether in electoral system or in legislature.

In essence, there are less effective parties in legislature than in elections.

## Institutions: Duverger's Law

- Single-ballot majoritarian -> two-party
  - Small parties disincentivised from formation (difficult to win seats)
    - Voters don't want to throw away their votes for a party that has no real chance
  - Rally around one of the top two who is most likely to win
- Proportional systems -> multiparty
  - Small parties have small threshold to win seats
  - Citizens can vote less strategically and more "with their hearts"
- Majoritarian with run-off systems -> multiparty

## Social Cleavages Theory (Lipset and Rokkan)

*It is not the case that every citizen forms a preference ordering independent of every other citizen.*

People are influenced by the people around them from the moment they are born.

1. Huge societal changes
2. Shift in social divisions
3. Collective identities form
4. Organisations form
5. Political parties emerge
6. Party system "freezes"

Inglehart: Initially, only property-owning white males could vote.
All of a sudden, you have lower working-class allowed to vote, which causes divisions.

### Four Main Cleavages in Europe

Impact of the development of the nation state:

- State vs. Church (religiosity)
  - Mostly evident in Christian Democrat parties
  - A key issue for other parties that might not have "Christian" in their names
- Centre vs. periphery (territorial) (urban/rural divide)
  - Some states better than others at assimilating other cultures into the majority nation
  - Tensions between elites in central administrative areas and those in more outlying areas
  - Usually expressed in terms of regional nationalism (language/religion divide)

Impact of the Industrial Revolution:

- Owner vs. worker (class)
  - Left and the right
  - Mostly economical conflict
- Land vs. industry (urban/rural)
  - Tension between industrial and agricultural sectors on trade policies such as continued state exercise of control over **tariffs**
  - Some agrarian/peasant parties, e.g. Finnish Centre Party, Polish Peasants People's Party

### More on Class Cleavage

- Industrial revolution
  - Workers vs. capitalists
  - Proletariat vs. property-owning bourgeoisie
  - Peasants vs. large landowners
- Redistribution (centralised economy) vs. free market and smaller state
- Foundation of left-right divide across many countries today

### Post-Material Cleavage

Post-WWII:

- High levels of existential security -> intergenerational value shift
- Erosion of materialist values
- Rise of post-materialist values prioritising individual free choice and self-expression

This is eventually expressed in political outcomes

#### What are "Materialist Values"?

Meeting basic needs, e.g.:
- Security
- Sustenance
- Shelter

Hypothesis: The most pressing needs must be met first.

#### What are "Post-Materialist Values"?

See also: [[7 Cultural Determinants]]

- Freedom of speech
- Gender equality, race, LGBTQ+
- Environmentalism
- Citizen input and political participation
- Individual improvement

## College Education and Urbanisation

Education effects:

- More exposure to different backgrounds, cultures, etc.
- May speak more languages, take new classes
- More women in education compared to immediately post-WWII
- Therefore, higher tolerance

## Effects of Post-Material Cleavage on Politics

Inglehart: Older cohorts are more likely to vote for authoritarian, populist movements/parties/leaders.

Younger generations are more likely to vote for "status quo".

**Duverger's Theory**:
Politicised social cleavages -- (strategic effect of electoral laws) -> electoral parties -- (mechanical effect of electoral laws) -> legislative parties
