In [[4.6 Linear Approximation and Differentials|4.6]], we learned about the linear approximation of $f(x)$:

$$ L(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) $$

However, as we get further from $a$, this approximation gets worse.

We could do better with a curvier approximation, such as a quadratic function that has the same first derivative and second derivative at $x = a$:

$$ p_2(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + \frac{f''(a)}{2}(x - a)^2 $$

- Note: $p_2(a)$ and $f(a) must share the same value, slope, and concavity

Derivatives of $p_2(x)$ are:
$p_2(x) = c_0 + c_1(x - a) + c_2(x - a)^2$
${p_2}'(x) = c_1 + 2c_2(x - a)$
${p_2}''(x) = 2c_2$

Since ${p_2}''(a) = f''(a)$ and ${p_2}''(a) = 2c_2$, $c_2 = \dfrac{f''(a)}{2}$.

### Example

> Find the quadratic approximation for $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ centered at $x = 4$.

We need:
$f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ -> $f(4) = 2$
$f'(x) = \dfrac{1}{2 \sqrt{x}}$ -> $f'(4) = \dfrac{1}{4}$
$f''(x) = - \dfrac{1}{4x^\frac{3}{2}}$ -> $f''(4) = -\dfrac{1}{32}$

$$ p_2(x) = 2 + \frac{1}{4}(x - 4) - \dfrac{1}{64}(x - 4)^2 $$

Polynomials of larger degree give better approximations.

These are $n$th-degree **Taylor Polynomials** centred at $a$:

$$ f(x) \approx p_n(x) = \frac{f(a)}{0!}(x - a)^0 + \frac{f'(a)}{1!}(x - a)^1 + \frac{f''(a)}{2!}(x - a)^2 + \frac{f'''(a)}{3!}(x - a)^3 + \dots $$

Or

$$ f(x) \approx p_n(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n \frac{f^{(k)}(a)}{k!}(x - a)^k $$

Where $f^{(k)}(a)$ is the $k$th derivative of $f(a)$.
