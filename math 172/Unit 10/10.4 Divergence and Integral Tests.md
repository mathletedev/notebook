> *Theorem 10.9: Divergence Test*
> If $\displaystyle \sum a_k$ converges, then $\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} a_k = 0$. Equivalently, if $\displaystyle \lim_{k \to \infty} a_k \neq 0$, then the series diverges.

- Note: the Divergence Test can **NOT** be used to determine that a series is convergent

## Harmonic Sequence

$$ \left\{ \frac{1}{n} \right\} = \left\{ 1, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{5}, \dots \right\} $$

These terms converge to zero, but the **Harmonic Series**
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k} = 1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{5} + \dots $$
is famously *divergent*.

### Example

> According to the Divergence Test, is the following series convergent, divergent, or is the Divergence Test inconclusive?
> $$ \sum_{k = 0}^\infty \frac{4k^2 - k^3}{10 + 2k^3} $$

This series diverges because the limit is -1/2.

> *Theorem 10.11: Integral Test*
> Suppose $f$ is a continuous, positive, decreasing function, for $x \geq 1$ and let $a_k = f(k)$ for $k = 1, 2, 3, \dots$. Then
> $$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty a_k \text{ and } \int_1^\infty f(x) \, dx $$
> either both converge or both diverge. In the case of convergence, the value of the integral is *not* equal to the value of the series.

### Examples

> According to the Integral Test, is the following series convergent, divergent, or is the Integral Test inconclusive?
> $$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k^2} $$

Since the improper integral $\displaystyle \int_1^\infty \dfrac{1}{x^2} \, dx$ converges to 1, the series also converges.

> According to the Integral Test, is the following series convergent, divergent, or is the Integral Test inconclusive?
> $$ \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{1}{k} $$

Since the improper integral $\displaystyle \int_1^\infty \dfrac{1}{x} \, dx$ diverges, the series also diverges.

> *Theorem 10.12: Convergence of the $p$-series*
> The **$p$-series** $\displaystyle \sum_{k = 1}^\infty \dfrac{1}{k^p}$ converges for $p > 1$ and diverges for $p \leq 1$.

> *Theorem 10.8: Properties of Convergent Series*
> 1. Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges to $A$ and $c$ is a real number. The series $\sum ca_k$ converges, and $\sum ca_k = c \sum a_k = cA$.
> 2. Suppose $\sum a_k$ diverges. Then $\sum ca_k$ diverges, for any real number $c \neq 0$.
> 3. Suppose $\sum a_k$ converges to $A$ and $\sum b_k$ converges to $B$. The series $\sum (a_k \pm b_k)$ converges, and $\sum (a_k \pm b_k) = \sum a_k \pm \sum b_k = A \pm B$.
> 4. Suppose $\sum a_k$ diverges and $\sum b_k$ converges. then $\sum (a_k \pm b_k)$ diverges.
> 5. If $M$ is a positive integer, then $\sum_{k = 1}^\infty a_k$ and $\sum_{k = M}^\infty a_k$ either both converge or both diverge. In general, *whether* a series converges does not depend on a finite number of terms added to or removed from the series. However, the *value* of a convergent series does change if non-zero terms are added or removed.
