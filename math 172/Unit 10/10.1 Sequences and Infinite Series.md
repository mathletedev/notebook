> A sequence is a list of numbers written in some specific order:
> $$ 3, 6, 12, 24, \dots $$
> Notation:
> $$ \{a_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty = \{a_n\} = \{3, 6, 12, 24, \dots\} $$

We can write $\{a_n\} = \{3, 6, 12, 24, \dots\}$ implicitly as a **recurrence relation**:
$a_1 = 3$ and $a_{n + 1} = 2a_n$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$

Or, we can write $\{a_n\} = \{3, 6, 12, 24, \dots\}$ **explicitly**:
$a_n = 3 \times 2^{n - 1}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$
$\{a_n\}_{n = 1}^\infty = \{3 \times 2^{n - 1}\}_{n = 1}^\infty$

## Limits of sequences

$a_n = 3 \times 2^{n - 1}$ for $n = 1, 2, 3, \dots$ diverges. Or, $\{3 \times 2^{n - 1}\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ diverges.

### Examples

> Find the first five terms of the sequence $\{(-1)^n\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ and determine if the sequence is convergent or divergent.

| $n$ | $a_n$ |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | -1    |
| 2   | 1     |
| 3   | -1    |
| 4   | 1     |
| 5   | -1    |

The terms approach *no limit*. This sequence is divergent by **oscillation**.

> Find the first four terms of the sequence $a_n = \left\{ \dfrac{(-1)^n}{n^2} \right\}_{n = 1}^\infty$ and determine if the sequence is convergent or divergent.

| $n$ | $a_n$ |
| --- | ----- |
| 1   | -1    |
| 2   | 1/4   |
| 3   | -1/9  |
| 4   | 1/16  |

This sequence converges to 0 by oscillation.
The terms are **bounded** by -1 and 1/4.

## Infinite series

Consider the finite number $0.333333\dots = 0.\bar{3}$.

This can be written as a sum of infinitely many terms:
$S = 0.\bar{3} = 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003 + 0.0003 + \dots$

If we stop at any point, that's a **partial sum**:
$S_1 = 0.3$
$S_2 = 0.3 + 0.03$
$S_3 = 0.3 + 0.03 + 0.003$

The $n$th partial sum $S_n$ is
$$ S_n = \sum_{k = 1}^n (3 \times 0.1^k) $$

---

The sum of the terms in a sequence of partial sums is an **infinite series**.

If the sequence of the partial sums has a limit $L$, the series converges to that limit $L$.

From our earlier sequence of partial sums $\sum_{k = 1}^n (3 \times 0.1^k)$,

$$ L = \lim_{n \to \infty} S_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{k = 1}^n (3 \times 0.1^k) = \sum_{k = 1}^\infty (3 \times 0.1^k) = \frac{1}{3} $$

### Example

Consider the infinite series $\sum_{n = 1}^\infty \left( \dfrac{1}{2} \right)^n$.
