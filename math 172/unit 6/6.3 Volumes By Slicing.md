> Consider the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by some function $f(x)$ about the $x$-axis.

Area of each slice:

$A = \pi r^2$
$r = R(x)$
So
$A = \pi R(x)^2$

The volume of the solid is the sum of all these slices:

> $$ V = \pi \int_a^b R(x)^2 \, dx $$

This is known as the **disk method**.

### Examples

> Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y = x^2$ from $x = 1$ to $x = 2$ about the $x$-axis

![[6.3 Volumes By Slicing 2024-01-17 09.37.44.excalidraw]]

$V = \pi \displaystyle \int_1^2 (x^2)^2 \, dx = \pi \int_1^2 x^2 \ dx$

> Find the volume of the solid generated by revolving the region bounded by $y = \sqrt{x - 1}$ and $y = (x - 1)^2$ about the $x$-axis.

Every slice has a hole in it, so the slices look like washers
This is known as the **washer method**.

$$ V = \pi \displaystyle \int_a^b \left[ R(x)^2 - r(x)^2 \right] \, dx $$

$V = \pi \displaystyle \int_1^2 \left[ (\sqrt{x - 1})^2 - ((x - 1)^2)^2 \right] \, dx$
$= \pi \displaystyle \int_1^2 \left[ (x - 1) - (x - 1)^4 \right] \, dx$
Let $u = x - 1$
$= \pi \displaystyle \int_0^1 (u - u^4) \, dx$
$= \dfrac{3}{10} \pi$
