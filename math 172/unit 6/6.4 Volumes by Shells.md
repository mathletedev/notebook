If volume of a cylindrical shell is
$$ V = (2 \pi r)(\Delta r)h $$

![[6.4 Volumes By Shells 2024-01-19 09.38.26.excalidraw]]

The total volume of all shells would be

> $$ 2 \pi \int_a^b x f(x) \, dx $$

- Note: the radius is not necessarily $x$; use a diagram to find the radius

### Example

> Find the volume of the solid formed when the region bounded by $f(x) = -\dfrac{4}{9}(x^2 - 10x + 16)$ and the $x$-axis is revolved about the $y$-axis.

![[6.4 Volumes By Shells 2024-01-19 09.54.14.excalidraw]]

$V = 2 \pi \displaystyle \int_2^8 x \left(-\dfrac{4}{9}(x^2 - 10x + 16) \right) \, dx$
$= 160 \pi$
