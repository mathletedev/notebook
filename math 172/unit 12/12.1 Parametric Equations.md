Functions like $y = f(x)$ do not work for all curves.

For instance, we can't write $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ as a single equation.

## Parametric equations

Define both $x$ and $y$ in terms of a third variable called a *parameter*:
$$ x = f(t) \quad y = g(t) $$

Each value of $t$ defines a point $(x, y) = (f(t), g(t))$.

The collection of points that we get by letting $t$ be all possible values is called the **parametric curve**.

> *Example*
> Sketch the parametric curve. Use an arrow to indicate the direction in which $t$ increases.
> $$ x = t^2 \quad y = 2t $$

| t   | x   | y   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -2  | 4   | -4  |
| -1  | 1   | -2  |
| 0   | 0   | 0   |
| 1   | 1   | 2   |
| 2   | 4   | 4    |

> *Example*
> Eliminate the parameter from the following set of parametric equations.
> $$ x = t^2 \quad y = 2t $$

$t = \dfrac{y}{2}$
$= \left( \dfrac{y}{2} \right)^2$
$= g(y) = \dfrac{1}{4}y^2$

> *Example*
> Determine $\dfrac{dy}{dx}$ in terms of $t$ and evaluate it at $t = 1$.

$\dfrac{dx}{dt} = 2t$
$\dfrac{dy}{dt} = 2$

$\dfrac{dy}{dx} = \dfrac{\dfrac{dy}{dt}}{\dfrac{dx}{dt}} = \dfrac{2}{2t} = \dfrac{1}{t}$

At $t = 1$, $\dfrac{dy}{dx} \Bigg|_{t = 1} = \dfrac{1}{t} \Bigg|_{t = 1} = \dfrac{1}{1} = 1$

At $t = 1$, the slope of the tangent to the curve is 1.

> *Example*
> Sketch the parametric curve for the following set of parametric equations. Use arrows to indicate direction of motion.
> $$ x = 5 \cos(3t), y = 2\sin(3t), 0 \leq t \leq 2 \pi $$

We will use an alternate method to plotting points.

Solve the two parametric equations for sine and cosine as follows:
$\cos(3t) = \dfrac{x}{5}$
$\sin(3t) = \dfrac{y}{2}$

$\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1$
$\left( \dfrac{x}{5} \right)^2 + \left( \dfrac{y}{2} \right)^2 = 1$
$\dfrac{x^2}{25} + \dfrac{y^2}{4} = 1$

When $x = 0$, $y = \pm 2$
When $y = 0$, $x = \pm 5$

The parametric equations
$$ x = x_0 + at \quad y = y_0 + bt \quad -\infty < t < \infty $$
give a line with slope $\dfrac{b}{a}$ passing through the point $(x_0, y_0)$.

> *Example*
> Find parametric equations of the line segment starting at $P(2, -1)$ and ending at $Q(6, 5)$.

$(x_0, y_0) = (2, -1)$
$\text{slope} = \dfrac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \dfrac{5 - (-1)}{6 - 2} = \dfrac{6}{4}$

$x = x_0 + at = 2 + 4t$
$y = y_0 + bt = -1 + 6t$
$0 \leq t \leq 1$
