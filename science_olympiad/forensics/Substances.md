## Sodium Acetate
$$ C_2H_3NaO_2 $$
Otherwise known as `Na O Ac`, where `Ac` is an acetyl group (`C2 H3 O`)
Colourless, deliquescent salt
Vinegar-like odour when heated to decomposition
Cultures bacteria
Eliminates static electricity
Epoxy alternative for sealant
Salt and vinegar flavour (sometimes used for potato chips)
Shelf-life extending agent
pH control agent
Safe to eat at low concentration
Used in heating pads / hand warmers through crystallisation, an exothermic reaction

## Sodium Chloride
$$ NaCl $$
Commonly known as table salt
Condiment and food preservative
De-ices roadways
Principal extinguishing agent in fire extinguishers

## Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate / Sodium Bicarbonate
$$ NaHCO_3 $$
Otherwise known as baking soda
Leavening agent - when reacting with acid, releases carbon dioxide:
$$ NaHCO_3 + H^+ >> Na^+ + CO_2 + H_2O $$
Heat itself can cause sodium bicarbonate to act as a raising agent through thermal decomposition:
$$ 2NaHCO_3 >> Na_2CO_3 + H_2O + CO_2 $$
but this produces sodium carbonate in the absence of an acid, giving the baked product a bitter taste and yellow colour
One of the main components of the "black snake" firework - when burned, produces a long snake-like ash
Weak disinfectant properties, can be used as a fungicide
Can extinguish small grease or electrical fires
