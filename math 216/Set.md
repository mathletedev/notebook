> *Definition (informal)*
> A **set** is a collection of elements.

$x \in S$ -> $x$ is an element of set $S$.
$x \notin S$ -> $x$ is not an element of set $S$.

Set roster notation:
$S = \set{1, 2, 3}$

Set builder notation:
$p(x)$ - A property that may or may not hold for $x \in S$. Given $S$, define 

$R = \set{x \in S \mid x \text{ is a multiple of 2}}$ = The set of even positive integers.

## Subsets

$A \subset B$ if and only if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.

$A \not\subset B$ means there is at least one element $x$ of $A$ such that $x \notin B$.
