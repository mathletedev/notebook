> *Definition: Graph*
> A **graph** $G$ consists of two sets:
> - $V(G)$: Vertices
> - $E(G)$: Edges

An edge is incident on each of its endpoints. Two edges incident on the same endpoint are called *adjacent*.
A vertex on which no edges are incident is called *isolated*.

> *Definition: Directed Graph*
> A **directed graph** (or digraph) consists of two finite sets:
> - $V(G)$: Vertices
> - $D(G)$: Set of directed edges

> *Definition: Degree*
> Let $G$ be a graph and $v$ a vertex of $G$. The **degree** of $v$ (denoted $\deg(v)$) equals the number of edges that are incident on $v$, with an edge that is a loop counted twice.
