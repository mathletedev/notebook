Initial undefined forms:
- Sentence
- True
- False

> *Definition: Statement*
> A **statement** is a sentence that is true or false but not both.

E.g.:
- $x + y > 0$: Not a statement
- $2 + 4 = 0$: Is a statement (false)
- $2 + 4 = 6$: Is a statement (true)

Let $p$, $q$ be statements.

Notation:
- $\lnot p$ is the **negation** of $p$ ("not $p$").
- $p \land q$ is the **conjunction** of $p$, $q$ ("$p$ and $q$").
- $p \lor q$ is the **disjunction** of $p$, $q$ ("$p$ or $q$").

Note: The natural order of operations is left to right. This can be changed using parentheses.

## Logical Equivalence

> *Definition: Equivalent Statements*
> Equivalent statements are either both true or both false.

E.g. $p \land q$ and $q \land p$ are equivalent.

We can test logical equivalence using a truth table.
