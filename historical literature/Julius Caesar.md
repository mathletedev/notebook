## Roman society
**Patricians**: small group of aristocratic families
**Plebians**: The commoners, members of the lower social class

Also had slaves with no rights
Women were citizens but couldn't vote

**Consuls** (2): 6-month dictators
**Senators** (100): served for lifetime, created policies for Consuls
**Tribunes** (10): plebians who could veto Senators' policies

## Gaius (King) Julius
Married 3 different times
Elected Consul
After Consul, became governor and was deeply in debt, sought land to raise money for Rome
Formed the first Triumvirate, 3 people with power over Rome

### Triumvirate
- Gnaeus Pompeius
- Marcus Licinius Crassus
- Julius Caesar

After Crassus was killed, Pompey ordered Caesar to come back, Caesar kicked him out and became dictator for a lifetime

### Gaius Octavius
Caesar's grandnephew, who was adopted in order to have an heir
Later renamed Augustus
Killed Caesar's son with Cleopatra (Caesarion) to avoid any conflict

### Why was Caesar so popular?
- Redistributed land among the poor
- Created police force
- Abolished tax reforms
And more!

However, unpopular with the Senate because he ruled without regard to the Senate
Often told them which laws he wanted passed and how quickly

## Exigence of the play
Queen Elizabeth didn't have an heir, similar to Caesar
Both had tremendous political power
It was treason to imagine the death of a current ruler, so Shakespeare criticised current rulers my altering the deaths of past rulers
Tragedy writing style, title characters always die
[[historical literature/Rhetoric]] was only available to the upper class, so only the well-educated could utilise rhetoric to convince people

### Brutus
Backstabbed Caesar
Ancestors overthrew tyrannical kings, wouldn't allow Caesar to rule

### Mark Antony
Marcus Antonius
Very good general, became co-Consul after Caesar's death

### Cleopatra
Last pharaoh of ancient Egypt
Caesar's wife?
Caesar provided Cleopatra with reinforcements to defeat her husband-brother for power over Egypt
Also had twins with Antony, Antony died in battle, Cleopatra committed suicide
