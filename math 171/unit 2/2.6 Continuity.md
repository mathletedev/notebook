> *Definition: Continuity at a Point*
> A function $f$ is **continuous** at $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$

- The graph is "connected" at that point

### Continuity Checklist

In order for $f$ to be continuous at $a$, the following three conditions must hold.

1. $f(a)$ is defined ($a$ is in the domain of $f$).
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ (the value of $f$ equals the limit of $f$ at $a$).
