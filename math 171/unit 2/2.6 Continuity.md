> *Definition: Continuity at a Point*
> A function $f$ is **continuous** at $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$

- The graph is "connected" at that point

### Continuity Checklist

In order for $f$ to be continuous at $a$, the following three conditions must hold.

1. $f(a)$ is defined ($a$ is in the domain of $f$).
2. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ (the value of $f$ equals the limit of $f$ at $a$).

## Discontinuity

A function $f$ is *discontinuous* at $x = a$ if $f$ is defined at all $x$ values to the immediate left and right of $a$, but $f$ is not continuous at $a$.

### Types of discontinuity

- **removable** discontinuity: the point at $x = a$ is in the wrong place
- **jump** discontinuity: the graph breaks and jumps at $x = a$
- **infinite** discontinuity: the graph shoots to infinity or negative infinity

> Consider $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

```desmos-graph
f(x) = \sqrt{x}
```

This graph is continuous at all $x > 0$, but is no continuous at $x = 0$ (there is no left-sided limit at $x = 0$).

> *Theorem 2.10: Polynomial and Rational Functions*
> 1. A polynomial function is continuous for all $x$.
> 2. A rational function (a function of the form $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials) is continuous for all $x$ for which $q(x) \neq 0.$

### Example

> Determine the interval(s) on which
> $$ f(x) = \frac{x^5 + 6x + 17}{x^2 - 9} $$
> is continuous

The zeros of $q$ are 3 and -3. Therefore, the intervals on which $f(x)$ is continuous are $(-\infty, -3), (-3, 3), (3, \infty)$.

- Be careful with brackets!

> *Definition: Continuity at Endpoints*
> A function $f$ is **continuous from the right** (or **right-continuous**) at $a$ if $\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)$, and $f$ is **continuous from the left** (or **left-continuous**) at $b$ if $\lim_{x \to b^-} f(x) = f(b)$.

> *Definition: Continuity on an Interval*
> A function $f$ is **continuous on an interval $I$ if it is continuous at all points of $I$. If $I$ contains its endpoints, continuity on $I$ means continuous from the right or left at the endpoints.

> *Theorem 2.13: Continuity of Functions with Roots*
> Assume $n$ is a positive integer. If $n$ is an odd integer, then $(f(x))^\frac{1}{n}$ is continuous at all points at which $f$ is continuous.
> If $n$ is even, then $(f(x))^\frac{1}{n}$ is continuous at all points $a$ at which f is continuous and $f(a) > 0$.

### Example

> Determine the interval(s) on which
> $$ g(x) = \sqrt{2x - 6} $$
> is continuous

Find the x-values for which $2x - 6 > 0 \rightarrow x > 3$

> *Theorem 2.9: Continuity Rules*
> If $f$ and $g$ are continuous at $a$, then the following functions are also continuous at $a$. Assume $c$ is a constant and $n > 0$ is an integer.
> 1. $f + g$
> 2. $f - g$
> 3. $cf$
> 4. $fg$
> 5. $f / g$, provided $g(a) \neq 0$
> 6. $(f(x))^n$

> *Theorem 2.15: Continuity of Transcendental Functions*
> The following functions are continuous on their domains.
> $\sin x$ $\cos x$ $\tan x$ $\cot x$ $\sec x$ $\csc x$
> $\sin^{-1} x$ $\cos^{-1} x$ $\tan^{-1} x$ $\cot^{-1} x$ $\sec^{-1} x$ $\csc^{-1} x$
> $b^x$ $e^x$ $\log_b x$ $\ln x$

> *Theorem 2.16: Intermediate Value Theorem*
> Suppose $f$ is continuous on the interval $[a, b]$ and $L$ is a number strictly between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. Then there exists at least one number $c$ in $(a, b)$ satisfying $f(c) = L$.

### Example

> Show that a solution to $2x^3 + x - 2 = 0$ exists on the interval $(-1, 1)$.

Define $f(x) = 2x^3 + x - 2$.
- $f$ is continuous on $[-1, 1]$ since $f$ is a polynomial (Theorem 2.10)

$f(a) = f(-1) = 2(-1)^3 + (-1) - 2 = -5$
$f(b) = f(1) = 2(1)^3 + (1) - 2 = 1$

$L = 0$ is strictly between 1 and 5, so by the IVT (Intermediate Value Theorem), there must exist an $x$ value $c$ in $(-1, 1)$ where $f(c) = 0$.
