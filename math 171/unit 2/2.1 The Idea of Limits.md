## Discussing velocity in one dimension

<---------------------------------> s-axis

$S(t)$: position as a function of time $t$

$$ S(0) = 3, S(5) = -1 $$
$$ average\ velocity = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t} $$
$$ \frac{S(5) - S(0)}{5 - 0} = \frac{-1 - 3}{5} = -\frac{4}{5} (units) $$

In general, if as $t$ goes from $t = a$ to $t = b$, position goes from $S(a)$ to $S(b)$:
$$ \frac{S(b) - S(a)}{b - a} $$

## Instantaneous velocity

> Exercise 17: Consider the position function $S(t) = -16t^2 + 128t$
> Where t is time in seconds and s is position in feet. Complete the following table, then make a conjecture about the object's velocity at the instant when $t = 1$.

| Time interval (s) | Average velocity (ft/s) |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| \[1, 5] | 32 |
| \[1, 4] | 48 |
| \[1, 3] | 64 |
| \[1, 2] | 80 |
| \[1, 1.5] | 88 |
| \[1, 1.1] | 94.4 |
| \[1, 1.01] | 95.84 |
| \[1, 1.001] | 95.984 |

It *appears* at the velocity at time $t = 1$ is *96 ft/s*.

## Consider the graph:

$$ S(t) = -16t^2 + 128t $$
$$ = -16t(t - 8) $$
- Parabola, opens down, t-intercepts at $t = [0, 8]$, vertex at $t = 4$

### Average velocity

> Secant line: "cuts through" a graph

By plotting two points on the parabola, you can use $\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$ to calculate the slope of the *secant line* - the average velocity between $t_1$ and $t_2$.

> Tangent line: "touches" a single point

As $t_2$ gets closer to $t_1$ (the "anchor"), the slope of the secant line between $t_1$ and $t_1$ approaches the *tangent line* at $t_1$.

It appears that the slope of the tangent line (the instantaneous velocity) at $t = 1$ is *96*.

## Generic description

We can describe what's happening above generically:

$$ m = \frac{S(b) - S(1)}{b - 1} $$

- As $b$ slides arbitrarily close to (approaches) 1, $m$ approaches the slope of the tangent line $t$.

So, the instantaneous velocity at $t = 1$ =

$$ \lim_{b \to 1} \frac{S(b) - S(1)}{b - 1} $$
