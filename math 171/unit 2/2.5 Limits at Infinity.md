> *Definition: Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes*
> If $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily close to a finite number $L$ for all sufficiently large and positive $x$, then we write
> $$ \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L $$
> We say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches infinity is $L$. In this case the line $y = L$ is a **horizontal asymptote** of $f$. The limit at negative infinity, $\lim_{x \to -\infty} = M$, is defined analogously and in this case the horizontal asymptote is $y = M$.

> *Definition: Infinite Limits at Infinity*
> If $f(x)$ becomes arbitrarily large as $x$ becomes arbitrarily large, then we write
> $$ \lim_{x \to infty} f(x) = \infty $$
> The limits $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = -\infty$, $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = \infty$, and $\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = -\infty$ are defined similarly.

> *Theorem 2.6: Limits at Infinity of Powers and Polynomials*
> Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be the polynomial $p(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n - 1} x^{n - 1} + \ldots + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0$, where $a_n \neq 0$.
> 1. $\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} x^n = \infty$ when $n$ is even.
> 2. $\lim_{x \to +\infty} x^n = \infty$ and $\lim_{x \to -\infty} x^n = -\infty$ when $n$ is odd.
> 3. $\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} \frac{1}{x^n} = \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} x^{-n} = 0$.
> 4. $\lim_{x \to \pm \infty} p(x) = \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} (a_n x^n) = \pm \infty$, depending on the degree of the polynomial and the sign of the leading coefficient $a_n$.
