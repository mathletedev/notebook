> What limits mean graphically

## Consider the function:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x} $$

- Note: $f(0)$ is not defined

| $x$   | $f(x)$    |
| ----- | --------- |
| -1    | -0.5      |
| -0.5  | -0.25     |
| -0.1  | -0.05     |
| -0.01 | -0.005    |
| 0     | undefined |
| 0.01  | 2.005     |
| 0.1   | 2.05      |
| 0.5   | 2.25      |
| 1     | 2.5       |

The points at $x = 0$ are undefined, so an open point is drawn at (0, 0) and (0, 2).

## One-sided limits

$$ \lim_{x \to a^-} = L $$
- This is a *left-sided* limit: $L$ is the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left

$$ \lim_{x \to a^+} = L $$
- This is a *right-sided* limit: $L$ is the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right

If $\lim_{x \to a^-} = \lim_{x \to a^+}$, then we can write it as $\lim_{x \to a}$
- This is a *two-sided* limit
	- If $\lim_{x \to a^-} \neq \lim_{x \to a^+}$, then $\lim_{x \to a}$ *DNE* (does not exist)
- Note: DNE is not a number, so don't use $=$ for DNE

-> Limits do not always exist. For a limit to exist, the "answer" must be a *single, finite value*.

```desmos-graph
left = -1.5; right = 1.5;
top = 1.5; bottom = -1.5;
---
f(x) = \sin \frac{1}{x}
x = 0 | dashed | red
```

Zeno's Paradox is an example of a DNE limit; $\lim_{x \to 0} \sin \frac{1}{x}$ DNE.

### Example

For $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x}$,
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^-} = 0 $$
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} = 2 $$

A closed point determines the value of $f(x)$ at that point and does not affect the value of limits.
