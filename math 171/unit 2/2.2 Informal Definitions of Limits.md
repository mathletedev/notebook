> What limits mean graphically

## Consider the function:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x} $$

- Note: $f(0)$ is not defined

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | ------ |
| -1 | -0.5 |
| -0.5 | -0.25 |
| -0.1 | -0.05 |
| -0.01 | -0.005 |
| 0 | undefined |
| 0.01 | 2.005 |
| 0.1 | 2.05 |
| 0.5 | 2.25 |
| 1 | 2.5 |

The points at $x = 0$ are undefined, so an open point is drawn at (0, 0) and (0, 2).

## One-sided limits

$$ \lim_{x \to a^-} = L $$
- This is a *left-sided* limit: $L$ is the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the left

$$ \lim_{x \to a^+} = L $$
- This is a *right-sided* limit: $L$ is the limit as $x$ approaches $a$ from the right

If $\lim_{x \to a^-} = \lim_{x \to a^+}$, then we can write it as $\lim_{x \to a}$
- This is a *two-sided* limit
	- If $\lim_{x \to a^-} \neq \lim_{x \to a^+}$, then $\lim_{x \to a}$ *DNE* (does not exist)
- Note: DNE is not a number, so don't use $=$ for DNE

-> Limits do not always exist. For a limit to exist, the "answer" must be a *single, finite value*.

Zeno's Paradox is an example of a DNE limit

### Example

For $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x}$,
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^-} = 0 $$
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} = 2 $$

A closed point determines the value of $f(x)$ at that point and does not affect the value of limits.
