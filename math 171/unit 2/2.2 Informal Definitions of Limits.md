> What limits mean graphically

## Consider the function:

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x} $$

-> Note: $f(0)$ is not defined

| $x$ | $f(x)$ |
| --- | ------ |
| -1 | -0.5 |
| -0.5 | -0.25 |
| -0.1 | -0.05 |
| -0.01 | -0.005 |
| 0 | undefined |
| 0.01 | 2.005 |
| 0.1 | 2.05 |
| 0.5 | 2.25 |
| 1 | 2.5 |

The points at $x = 0$ is undefined, so an open point is drawn at (0, 0) and (0, 2).

For $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x + 1 + \frac{|x|}{x}$,
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^-} = 0 $$
-> This is a **left-sided limit**
$$ \lim_{x \to 0^+} = 2 $$
-> This is a **left-sided limit**

A closed point determines the value of $f(x)$ at that point and does not affect the value of limits.
