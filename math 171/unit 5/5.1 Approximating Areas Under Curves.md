With many subintervals under a curve, we can approximate the area under the curve by summing the area of the rectangles formed by the subintervals.

**Riemann sum**: A sum of the subintervals on a graph
**Regular Riemann sum**: When the subintervals are of equal length

A generic, regular Riemann sum for $f(x)$ on $[a, b]$ with $n$ subintervals:
$$ R_n = f(x_1^*) \Delta x + f(x_2^*) \Delta x + \dots + f(x_n^*) \Delta x $$
where $\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{n}$.

## Sigma notation

$$ 2^2 + 3^2 + \dots + 98^2 = \sum_{k = 2}^{98} k^2 $$

A Riemann sum would be:
$$ \sum_{k = 1}^n f(x_k^*) \Delta x $$

> *Definition: Riemann Sum*
> Suppose $f$ is defined on a closed interval $[a, b]$, which is divided into $n$ subintervals of equal length $\Delta x$. If $x_k^*$ is any point in the $k$th subinterval $[x_{k - 1}, x_k]$, for $k = 1, 2, \dots, n,$ then
> $$ f(x_1^*) \Delta x + f(x_2^*) \Delta x + \dots + f(x_n^*) \Delta x $$
> is called a **Riemann sum** for $f$ on $[a, b]$. This sum is called
> - a **left Riemann sum** if $x_k^*$ is the left endpoint of $[x_{k - 1}, x_k]$;
> - a **right Riemann sum** if $x_k^*$ is the right endpoint of $[x_{k - 1}, x_k]$; and
> - a **midpoint Riemann sum** if $x_k^*$ is the midpoint of $[x_{k - 1}, x_k]$, for $k = 1, 2, \dots, n$.
