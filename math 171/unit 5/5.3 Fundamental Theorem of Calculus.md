> *Theorem 5.3 (Part 2): Fundamental Theorem of Calculus*
> If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a, b]$, then
> $$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a). $$

## Explanation

Since $f(x) = F'(x)$, we can write $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$ as $\int_a^b F'(x) \, dx$.
We are multiplying by $dx$, and $\text{slope } * dx = dy$.
Therefore, we are summing the $dy$s of $F(x)$ from $a$ to $b$.
This is the same as $F(b) - F(a)$.

### Notation (evaluated from)

$$ F(b) - F(a) = F(x) \Big|_a^b $$

## Area functions

Let $A(x)$ = net area under $y = f(x)$ from $a$ to $x$.
$$ A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt $$

- Note: cannot use $x$ in $f(x)$ because it is one of the limits

Since $A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt = F(t) \Big|_a^x = F(x) - F(a)$, $A(x)$ is one of the antiderivatives of $f(x)$, such that $A(a) = 0$.

> *Definition: Area Function*
> Let $f$ be a continuous function, for $t \geq a$. The **area function for $f$ with left endpoint $a$** is
> $$ A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt, $$
