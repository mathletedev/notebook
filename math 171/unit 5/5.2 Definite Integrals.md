Let $R_n$ denote the right Riemann sum.
As $n \to \infty$ and $\Delta x \to 0$,
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n) = \text{(exact area under graph)} $$

For some functions with many discontinuities, $\lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n)$ does not exist. When $\lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n)$ *does* exist, we say $f$ is **integrable** on $[a, b]$.

The **definite integral** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\sum_{k = 1}^n f(x_k^*) \Delta x\right) $$

## Notation

Addition cannot be used on infinitely many terms, so we use the term **integrate** for this type of sum.

$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$
$a$: lower limit of integration
$b$: upper limit of integration
$f(x)$: integrand
$dx$: width of each subinterval

$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx$ would look like this:
```desmos-graph
left = -1; right = 2;
top = 2; bottom = -1;
---
y = x^2
y < x^2 | 0 <= x <= 1 | y >= 0
```

> *Theorem 5.2: Integrable Functions*
> If $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ or bounded on $[a, b]$ with a finite number of discontinuities, then $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$.

> *Definition: Net Area*
> Consider the region $R$ bounded by the graph of a continuous function $f$ and the $x$

> 1. $\int_a^a f(x) \, dx = 0$
> 2. $\int_b^a f(x) \, dx = -\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$
> 3. $\int_a^b (f(x) \pm g(x)) \, dx = \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \pm \int_a^b g(x) \, dx$
> 4. $\int_a^b cf(x) \, dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$
> 5. $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \int_a^p f(x) \, dx + \int_p^b f(x) \, dx$
> 6. The function $|f|$ is integrable on $[a, b]$, and $\int_a^b |f(x)| \, dx$ is the sum of the areas of the regions bounded by the graph of $f$ and the $x$-axis on $[a, b]$.

> 7. If $f(x) \geq 0$ on $[a, b]$, then $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq 0$.
> 8. If $f(x) \geq g(x)$ on $[a, b]$, then $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \geq \int_a^b g(x) \, dx$.
> 9. If $m \leq f(x) \leq M$, then $m(b - a) \leq \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \leq M(b - a)$.
