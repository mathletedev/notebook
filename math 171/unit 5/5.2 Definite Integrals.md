Let $R_n$ denote the right Riemann sum.
As $n \to \infty$ and $\Delta x \to 0$,
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n) = \text{(exact area under graph)} $$

For some functions with many discontinuities, $\lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n)$ does not exist. When $\lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n)$ *does* exist, we say $f$ is **integrable** on $[a, b]$.

The **definite integral** of $f$ on $[a, b]$ is:
$$ \lim_{n \to \infty} (R_n) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(\sum_{k = 1}^n f(x_k^*) \Delta x\right) $$

## Notation

Addition cannot be used on infinitely many terms, so we use the term **integrate** for this type of sum.

$$ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx $$
$a$: lower limit of integration
$b$: upper limit of integration
$f(x)$: integrand
$dx$: width of each subinterval

$\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx$ would look like this:
```desmos-graph
left = -1; right = 2;
top = 2; bottom = -1;

y = x^2
y < x^2 | 0 <= x <= 1 | y >= 0
```
