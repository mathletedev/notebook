## Absolute extrema

> *Definition: Absolute Maximum and Minimum*
> Let $f$ be defined on a set $D$ containing $c$. If $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $D$, then $f(c)$ is an **absolute maximum** value of $f$ on $D$. If $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for every $x$ in $D$, then $f(c)$ is an **absolute minimum** value of $f$ on $D$. An **absolute extreme** value is either an absolute maximum value or an absolute minimum value.

### Example

For $f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 3$:

```desmos-graph
f(x) = (x - 2)^2 + 3
```

$f(2) = 3$ is the absolute minimum value of $f$ on $(-\infty, \infty)$.
This $f$ has no absolute maximum value on $(-\infty, \infty)$.

## Local extrema

> *Definition: Local Maximum and Minimum Values*
> Suppose $c$ is an interior point of some interval $I$ on which $f$ is defined. If $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$, then $f(c)$ is a **local maximum** value of $f$. If $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $I$, then $f(c)$ is a **local minimum** value of $f$.

- Note: a point that is removed is *not* an extreme value
	- In this case, the graph has no maximum/minimum if that point is the maximum/minimum
 
- Note: for a point to be considered a *local* extreme, the function at that point must be defined for both sides of that point

> *Theorem 4.2: Local Extreme Value Theorem*
> If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum value at $c$ and $f'(c)$ exists, then $f'(c) = 0$.

> *Definition: Critical Number*
> An interior point $c$ of the domain $f$ at which $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ fails to exist is called a **critical number** of $f$.

> *Theorem 4.1: Extreme Value Theorem*
> A function that is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ has an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value on that interval.
