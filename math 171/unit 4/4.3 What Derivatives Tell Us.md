> *Definition: Increasing and Decreasing Functions*
> Suppose a function $f$ is defined on an interval $I$. We say that $f$ is **increasing** on $I$ if $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$. We say that $f$ is **decreasing** on $I$ if $f(x_2) < f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$.

> *Theorem 4.7: Test for Intervals of Increase and Decrease*
> Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ and differentiable at all interior points of $I$. If $f'(x) > 0$ on all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$. If $f'(x) < 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.

> *Theorem 4.8: First Derivative Test*
> Assume $f$ is continuous on an interval that contains a critical point $c$, and assume $f$ is differentiable on an interval containing $c$, except perhaps at $c$ itself.
> - If $f'$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a **local maximum** at $c$.
> - If $f'$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a **local minimum** at $c$.
> - If $f'$ is positive on both sides near $c$ or negative on both sides near $c$, then $f$ has no local extreme value at $c$.

> *Theorem 4.9: One Local Extremum Implies Absolute Extremum*
> Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ that contains exactly one local extremum at $c$.
> - If a local maximum occurs at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute maximum of $f$ on $I$.
> - If a local minimum occurs at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute minimum of $f$ on $I$.
