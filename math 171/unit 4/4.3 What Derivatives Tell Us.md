## What does $f'(x)$ tell us about $f(x)$?

> *Definition: Increasing and Decreasing Functions*
> Suppose a function $f$ is defined on an interval $I$. We say that $f$ is **increasing** on $I$ if $f(x_2) > f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$. We say that $f$ is **decreasing** on $I$ if $f(x_2) < f(x_1)$ whenever $x_1$ and $x_2$ are in $I$ and $x_2 > x_1$.

> *Theorem 4.7: Test for Intervals of Increase and Decrease*
> Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ and differentiable at all interior points of $I$. If $f'(x) > 0$ on all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is increasing on $I$. If $f'(x) < 0$ at all interior points of $I$, then $f$ is decreasing on $I$.

> *Theorem 4.8: First Derivative Test*
> Assume $f$ is continuous on an interval that contains a critical point $c$, and assume $f$ is differentiable on an interval containing $c$, except perhaps at $c$ itself.
> - If $f'$ changes sign from positive to negative as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a **local maximum** at $c$.
> - If $f'$ changes sign from negative to positive as $x$ increases through $c$, then $f$ has a **local minimum** at $c$.
> - If $f'$ is positive on both sides near $c$ or negative on both sides near $c$, then $f$ has no local extreme value at $c$.

> *Theorem 4.9: One Local Extremum Implies Absolute Extremum*
> Suppose $f$ is continuous on an interval $I$ that contains exactly one local extremum at $c$.
> - If a local maximum occurs at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute maximum of $f$ on $I$.
> - If a local minimum occurs at $c$, then $f(c)$ is the absolute minimum of $f$ on $I$.

## What does $f''(x)$ tell us about $f(x)$?

$f''(x)$ = $\frac{d (\text{slope})}{dx}$

If $f''(x)$ is positive at all $x$ in some interval $I$, then $f$ is "concave up" on $I$. (blue line)
If $f''(x)$ is negative at all $x$ in some interval $I$, then $f$ is "concave down" on $I$. (red line)

```desmos-graph
y = x^2
y = -x^2 | red
```

Thus, $f''(x)$ shows the concavity of the graph of $f(x)$.

> *Definition: Concavity and Inflection Point*
> Let $f$ be differentiable on an open interval $I$. If $f'$ is increasing on $I$, then $f$ is **concave up** on $I$. If $f'$ is decreasing on $I$, then $f$ is **concave down** on $I$.
> If $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $f$ changes concavity at $c$ (from up to down, or vice versa), then $f$ has an **inflection point** at $c$.

> *Theorem 4.10: Test for Concavity*
> Suppose $f''$ exists on an open interval $I$.
> - If $f'' > 0$ on $I$, then $f$ is concave up on $I$.
> - If $f'' < 0$ on $I$, then $f$ is concave down on $I$.
> - If $c$ is a point of $I$ at which $f''$ changes sign at $c$ (from positive to negative, or vice versa), then $f$ has an inflection point at $c$.

> *Theorem 4.11: Second Derivative Test for Local Extrema*
> Suppose $f''$ is continuous on an open interval containing $c$ with $f'(c) = 0$.
> - If $f''(c) > 0$ on $I$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $c$.
> - If $f''(c) < 0$ on $I$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $c$.
> - If $f''(c) = 0$, then the test is inconclusive; $f$ may have a local maximum, a local minimum, or neither at $c$.
