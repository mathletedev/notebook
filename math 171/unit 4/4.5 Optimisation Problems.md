*objective quantity*: the variable you are trying to optimise
*objective function*: a function that describes the objective quantity
*constraint*: a restriction on the variables in the objective function

- Note: must prove that the **absolute extremum** has been found, not a local extremum

## Optimisation guidelines (Remaley's version)

1. Identify the *objective quantity*
2. Write the *objective function* (introduce variables)
3. If necessary, apply the *constraint* equation to write the objective function as a function of a single variable
4. Apply calculus to the single-input objective function (note the *interval of interest*, or the range of physically possible/relevant inputs)

### Methods of proof

## Example

> *Example 1: Rancher's dilemma*
> A rancher has 400 ft of fence for constructing a rectangular corral. One side of the corral will be formed by a barn and requires no fence. Three exterior fences and two interior fences partition the corral into three rectangular regions as shown in `Figure 4.58`. What are the dimensions of the corral that maximise the enclosed area? What is the area of that corral?

**Objective quantity**: area of the corral
**Objective function**: $A = xy$
**Constraint**: $x + 4y = 400 \rightarrow x = 400 - 4y$

For $A = (400 - 4y) \cdot y$, $A$ is maximised at $y = 50$.
Therefore, the maximum area of the corral is $200 \cdot 50 = 10000 (\text{ft}^2)$.
