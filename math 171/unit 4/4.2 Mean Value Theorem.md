> *Theorem 4.3: Rolle's Theorem*
> Let $f$ be continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$ with $f(a) = f(b)$. There is at least one point in $(a, b)$ such that $f'(c) = 0$.

> *Theorem 4.4: Mean Value Theorem*
> If $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a, b]$ and differentiable on $(a, b)$, then there is at least one point $c$ in $(a, b)$ such that
> $$ \frac{f(b) - f(a)}{b - a} = f'(c).$$

### Examples

> Apply Rolle's Theorem to $f(x) = x(x - 1)^2$ on the interval $[0, 1]$.

- $[0, 1]$ is a closed interval
- Since $f$ is polynomial, $f$ is continuous and differentiable everywhere

$f(0) = f(1) = 0$

$f'(x) = (x - 1)(3x - 1)$
Set $f'(x)$ equal to 0:
$(x - 1)(3x - 1) = 0$
$x = 1, \frac{1}{3}$

In the open interval $(0, 1)$, $f'(x) = 0$ for $x = \frac{1}{3}$.

> Apply the MVT to $f(x) = x + \frac{1}{x}$ on the interval $[1, 3]$.

- $[1, 3]$ is a closed interval
- Since $f(x)$ is a rational function with its only discontinuity at $x = 0$, $f$ is continuous and differentiable in the interval $[1, 3]$

$\frac{f(1) - f(3)}{1 - 3} = \frac{2}{3}$

$f'(x) = 1 - \frac{1}{x^2}$
Set $f'(x)$ equal to $\frac{2}{3}$:
$1 - \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{2}{3}$
$\frac{x^2 - 1}{x^2} = \frac{2}{3}$
$3(x^2 - 1) = 2x^2$
$3x^2 - 3 = 2x^2$
$x^2 = 3$
$x = \pm \sqrt 3$

In the open interval $(1, 3)$, $f'(x) = \frac{2}{3}$ for $x = \sqrt 3$.

> *Theorem 4.5: Zero Derivative Implies Constant Function*
> If $f$ is differentiable and $f'(x) = 0$ at all points of an open interval $I$, then $f$ is a constant function on $I$.

> *Theorem 4.6: Functions with Equal Derivatives Differ by a Constant*
> If two functions have the property that $f'(x) = g'(x)$, for all $x$ of an open interval $I$, then $f(x) - g(x) = C$ on $I$, where $C$ is a constant; that is, $f$ and $g$ differ by a constant.
