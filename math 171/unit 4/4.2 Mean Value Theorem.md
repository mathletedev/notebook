> *Theorem 4.2: Local Extreme Value Theorem*
> If $f$ has a local maximum or minimum value at $c$ and $f'(c)$ exists, then $f'(c) = 0$.

> *Definition: Critical Number*
> An interior point $c$ of the domain $f$ at which $f'(c) = 0$ or $f'(c)$ fails to exist is called a **critical number** of $f$.

> *Theorem 4.1: Extreme Value Theorem*
> A function that is continuous on a closed interval $[a, b]$ has an absolute maximum value and an absolute minimum value on that interval.
