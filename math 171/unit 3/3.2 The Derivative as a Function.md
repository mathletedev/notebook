> Given a function $f(x)$, we can define a new function, related to $f(x)$, as follows:
> $$ f'(x) = \text{slope of graph of f at x} $$
> $f'$ is the *derivative function* of $f$.

We can modify the following limit:
$$ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h} $$
by substituting $a$ with $x$:
$$ \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} $$
to get the definition of $f'(x)$.

When substituting the parameter in a function such as
$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{4x^2}, $$
think:
$$ f(\fbox{}) = \frac{1}{4 \fbox{}^2} $$

### Alternative notation

$$ f'(x) = \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) $$
Where $y = f(x)$

> *Definition: The Derivative Function*
> The **derivative** of $f$ is the function
> $$ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}, $$
> provided the limit exists and $x$ is in the domain of $f$. If $f'(x)$ exists, we say that $f$ is **differentiable** at $x$. If $f$ is differentiable at every point of an open interval $I$, we say that $f$ is differentiable on $I$.

Basically, for $f$ to be differentiable at $x$, the graph of $f$ at $x$ must be "smooth".
In other words, if we zoom in to $f$ at $x$, the graph should be indistinguishable from a straight line.

> *When Is a Function Not Differentiable at a Point?*
> A function $f$ is *not* differentiable at $a$ if at least one of the following conditions holds:
> 1. $f$ is not continuous at $a$.
> 2. $f$ has a corner at $a$.
> 3. $f$ has a vertical tangent at $a$.

### Visual examples

- $f(x) = x^2$ *is* differentiable at $x = 0$:

```desmos-graph
f(x) = x^2
```
```desmos-graph
left = -0.0001; right = 0.0001;
top = 0.0001; bottom = -0.0001;
---
f(x) = x^2
```

- $f(x) = \sqrt[3]x$ *is not* differentiable at $x = 0$ (condition 3):

```desmos-graph
f(x) = \sqrt[3]x
```
```desmos-graph
left = -0.0001; right = 0.0001;
top = 0.0001; bottom = -0.0001;
---
f(x) = \sqrt[3]x
```

> *Theorem 3.1: Differentiable Implies Continuous*
> If $f$ is differentiable at $a$, then $f$ is continuous at $a$.

> *Theorem 3.1 (Alternate Version): Not Continuous Implies Not Differentiable*
> If $f$ is not continuous at $a$, then $f$ is not differentiable at $a$.

### Example

> Find $f'(x)$ for $f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 1}$

$f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$
$= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{1}{(x + h) + 1} - \frac{1}{x + 1}}{h}$
$= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{x + 1 - (x + h + 1)}{(x + h + 1)(x + 1)}}{h}$
$= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{\frac{-h}{(x + h + 1)(x + 1)}}{h}$
$= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{-1}{(x + h + 1)(x + 1)}$
$= \frac{-1}{(x + (0) + 1)(x + 1)}$
$= -\frac{1}{(x + 1)^2}$

Therefore, $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{(x + 1)^2}$.

```desmos-graph
f(x) = \frac{1}{x + 1}
f(x) = -\frac{1}{(x + 1)^2}
```

## Sketching derivatives

The graph of $f'(x)$ is simply the slopes of $f(x)$ at each x-value.
- Note: if $f(x)$ is not differentiable at $a$, then there will be an open point at $x = a$

## Notation

$f'(t) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(t + h) - f(t)}{h}$
$= \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{\Delta u}{\Delta t}$
$= \frac{du}{dt}$ <- Leibniz notation 
$= \frac{d}{dt} (u)$ <- operator notation

- $d$ means an infinitely small change
