> *Definition: Rate of Change and the Slope of the Tangent Line*
> **The average rate of change** in $f$ on the interval $[a, x]$ is the slope of the corresponding secant line:
> $$ m_{sec} = \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}. $$
> The **instantaneous rate of change** in $f$ at $a$ is
> $$ m_{tan} = \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}, $$
> which is also the **slope of the tangent line** at $(a, f(a))$, provided this limit exists.
> The **tangent line** is the unique line through $(a, f(a))$ with slope $m_{tan}$. Its equation is

$m_{tan}$ is called the *derivative* of $f$ at $x = a$.

> *Alternative Definition: Rate of Change and the Slope of the Tangent Line*
> **The average rate of change** in $f$ on the interval $[a, a + h]$ is the slope of the corresponding secant line:
> $$ m_{sec} = \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}. $$
> The **instantaneous rate of change** in $f$ at $a$ is
> $$ m_{tan} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(a + h) - f(a)}{h}, $$
> which is also the **slope of the tangent line** at $(a, f(a))$, provided this limit exists.

## Example

> $$ f(x) = \frac{1}{x}; P(-2, -\frac{1}{2}) $$

$= \lim_{x \to a} \frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$
$= \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{\frac{1}{x} - (-\frac{1}{2})}{x - (-2)}$
$= \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{\frac{2 + x}{2x}}{x + 2}$
$= \lim_{x \to -2} \frac{1}{2x}$
$= -\frac{1}{4}$

## Slope-intercept form

The linear function with slope $m$ containing point $(a, b)$ can be written as
$$ y - b = m(x - a) $$
