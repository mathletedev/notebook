$$ \frac{d}{dt} ((x(t))^2 + (y(t))^2) = \frac{d}{dt} (0) $$

$$ 2x \frac{dx}{dt} + 2y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 $$
$$ x \frac{dx}{dt} + y \frac{dy}{dt} = 0 $$

> **Balloons**
> A spherical balloon is inflated and its volume increases at a rate of $15 \text{in}^3 / \text{min}$. What is the rate of change of its radius when the radius is $10 \text{in}$?

For a sphere, $V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3$.
Since $V$ and $r$ are both changing with time,
$\frac{d}{dt} (V) = \frac{d}{dt} \left(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^3\right)$
$\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 3 \cdot r^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}$
$\frac{dV}{dt} = 4 \pi r^2 \frac{dr}{dt}$

At the moment of interest (MOI),
$15 = 4 \pi (10)^2 \cdot \frac{dr}{dt}$
$\frac{dr}{dt} = \frac{15}{400 \pi} = \frac{3}{80 \pi}$

Therefore, the radius is increasing at a rate of $\frac{15}{400 \pi} \text{in} / \text{min}$.
