Consider:

| $f(x)$ | $f'(x)$ |
| ------ | ------- |
| $x^0$ | $0x^-1$ |
| $x^1$ | $1x^0$ |
| $x^2$ | $2x^1$ |
| $x^3$ | $3x^2$ |
| $x^4$ | $4x^3$ |

> *Theorem 3.3: Power Rule*
> If $n$ is a non-negative integer, then $\frac{d}{dx} (x^n) = nx^{n - 1}$.

(Actually, $n$ can be any real number)

> *Theorem 3.2: Constant Rule*
> If $c$ is a real number, then $\frac{d}{dx} (c) = 0$.

> *Theorem 3.4: Constant Multiple Rule*
> If $f$ is differentiable at $x$ and $c$ is a constant, then
> $$ \frac{d}{dx} (cf(x)) = cf'(x). $$

> *Theorem 3.5: Sum Rule*
> If $f$ and $g$ are differentiable at $x$, then
> $$ \frac{d}{dx} (f(x) + g(x)) = f'(x) + g'(x). $$
