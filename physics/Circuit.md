> A closed path that allows the flow of electricity

## Parallel
Batteries in parallel don't increase voltage
Voltage = the larger of the two batteries

## Series
Batteries in series increase voltage
Voltage = the sum of the two batteries

## Testing
Voltage: leads in parallel
[[Current]]: leads in series
[[Resistance]]: detach component, close circuit with leads
