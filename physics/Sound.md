> Waves through air

The speed of sound in air is influenced by temperature:
$$ v = 331 + 0.6T_c $$

## Intensity
$$ I = \dfrac{P}{A} = \dfrac{P}{4 \pi r^2} $$
P: power of wave
A: area of dispersion

$$ \dfrac{I_1}{I_2} = (\dfrac{r_2}{r_1})^2 $$

### Decibels
A measurement of sound intensity based on human hearing
$$ dB = 10 log(\dfrac{I}{I_0}) $$
Where $I_0 = 1.0 \cdot 10^{-12}$
