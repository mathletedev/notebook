> An object that exerts [[force]] based on how much it is squished or stretched

$$ F = -kx $$
F: the spring [[force]]
k: the spring constant (in N/m)
x: how far the spring is stretched from equilibrium

# Spring potential energy
Multiply the average force across the spring by the displacement
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} kx (x) $$

Note the 2 in the denominator to get the average force across the spring

$$ E_s = \frac{1}{2} kx^2 $$
