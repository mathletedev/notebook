> The [[force]] that goes against a moving object

$$ F = \mu N $$
F: the [[force]] of friction
mu: the coefficient of friction
N: the [[normal force]]

Friction is *not* influenced by speed or surface area

## Example
	A horizontal force of 95.0 N is applied to a 60.0 kg crate on a rough, level surface. If the crate accelerates at 1.2 m/s^2, what is the force of friction experienced by the crate?

23 N

# Static Friction
> The force of friction on a non-moving object

$$ \mu_s = tan \theta $$

### Maximum static friction
The maximum amount of force that the static friction can apply before the object starts moving

### Actual static friction
The amount of static friction currently experienced, equal to the force of the object's weight parallel to the surface
$$ \mu_s = W sin \theta $$

The force of friction does not exceed the force pushing against it
