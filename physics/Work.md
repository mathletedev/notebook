> Work is [[force]] applied over a distance

$$ W = F \cdot \Delta x $$

Work is measured in *joules* (J)

## Example
	Consider a 2 kg textbook that falls off a 1 meter tall desk. How much work is exerted on the book by gravity?

$$ W = F \cdot \Delta x $$
$$ W = 2kg (g) (1m) = 19.6J $$

# Angled forces
$$ W = F \cdot \Delta x \cdot cos \theta $$

If the force and [[displacement]] are in opposite directions, the work done is negative
