> A [[force]] that acts across space

Ex. [[Gravity & Weight]] & electrostatic force

## Modelling electric fields
- Closer lines mean stronger fields
- Electric force is tangent to field lines
- E-field lines start at positive [[charge]]s and end at negative charges
- Field lines **never** cross
- More field lines means more charge
