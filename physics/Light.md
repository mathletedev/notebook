> A [[wave]] that provides visibility

**Speed of light**: $3.0 \times 10^8m/s$

Light is both a wave and a particle

## Electromagnetic spectrum
Human eyes can only detect a small portion

## Planck's constant
$$ h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}Js $$

## Energy
$$ E = hf $$
h: Planck's constant
f: frequency of wave
