> A property of an object based on its mass and [[velocity]]

$$ p = mv $$

Measured in *kg m / s*

Note that p (Latin *petere*) is used because the variable m is already used

Momentum is related to [[force]]:
$$ \Delta p = F \Delta t $$

> Conservation of Momentum: Momentum is conserved in a system unless acted on by an external force
