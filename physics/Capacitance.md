> [[Charge]] stored between parallel plates

Capacitance is measured in *Farads* (F)

$$ C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} = \epsilon \frac{A}{d} $$
Where $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$
$\epsilon_0$: electric constant = $8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2$
$\epsilon_r$: relative permittivity / dielectric constant)
$d$: separation between plates (in metres)

$$ U_c = \frac{1}{2} QV $$

## Capacitors

### Parallel
$$ C_p = \sum_i C_i $$

### Series
$$ \frac{1}{C_s} = \sum_i \frac{1}{C_i} $$

## Time constant
The amount of time it takes a capacitor to build up what is deemed a useful amount of charge
Note that [[resistance]] controls the amount of time it takes for charge to build up
$$ \tau = RC $$

## Charging capacitors
$$ V_C = V_0 [1 - e^{-t / \tau}] $$

### Discharging
$$ V_C = V_0 e^{-t / \tau} $$
