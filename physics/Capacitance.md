> [[Charge]] stored between parallel plates

Capacitance is measured in *Farads* (F)

$$ C = \frac{Q}{\Delta V} = \epsilon \frac{A}{d} $$
Where $\epsilon = \epsilon_0 \epsilon_r$
$\epsilon_0$: electric constant = $8.85 \times 10^{-12} C^2/Nm^2$
$\epsilon_r$: relative permittivity / dielectric constant)
$d$: separation between plates (in metres)

$$ U_c = \frac{1}{2} QV $$

## Capacitors

### Parallel
$$ C_p = \sum_i C_i $$

### Series
$$ \frac{1}{C_s} = \sum_i \frac{1}{C_i} $$
