> When an object is at rest

- An object in translational equilibrium can still have rotational acceleration
- An object in rotational equilibrium can still have translational acceleration
- An object can be in both translational AND rotational equilibrium can still move

### Static Equilibrium
When an object is totally at rest

### Stable Equilibrium
Small displacement doesn't tip an object

### Unstable Equilibrium
Small displacement tips an object
