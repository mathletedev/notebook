> How images are affected by curved mirrors

Concave mirrors focus light inwards, convex mirrors spread light out

**Optical axis**: the center line of a spherical mirror
**Center of curvature** ($C$): point on the axis corresponding to the "sphere's" center
**Radius of curvature**: edge to center
**Focal point** ($f$): where reflected parallel rays intersect

## Concave mirrors
- Region 1
$s_o > C$
Inverted, shrunken virtual image appears
- Region 2
$s_o = C$
- Region 3
$s_o > f$
- Region 4
$s_o = f$
- Region 5
$s_o < f$

## Convex mirrors
Convex mirrors produce a virtual image, pinpointed by completing a ray diagram

Focus on the 3 main rays:
- Parallel ray: follows a path parallel to the optical axis; reflects in line with the focus
- Chief ray: in line with $C$
- Focal ray: in line with $f$, reflects parallel to axis

## Lenses

### Concave lens
Parallel rays diverge

### Convex lens
Parallel rays converge
