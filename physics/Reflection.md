> How light bounces off objects

*Angle of incidence = angle of reflection*

**Specular reflection**: when a surface is smooth, light reflects in a straight line
**Diffuse reflection**: when a surface is rough, light spreads out

## Mirrors
Irregularities are less than 100nm, which is smaller than the wavelengths of visible light

**Virtual image**: where the object is perceived to be

Draw lines where angle of incidence = angle of reflection into the eyes
