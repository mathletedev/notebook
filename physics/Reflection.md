> How [[light]] bounces off objects

*Angle of incidence = angle of reflection*

**Specular reflection**: when a surface is smooth, light reflects in a straight line
**Diffuse reflection**: when a surface is rough, light spreads out

## Mirrors
Irregularities are less than 100nm, which is smaller than the wavelengths of visible light

**Virtual image**: where the object is perceived to be

Draw lines where angle of incidence = angle of reflection into the eyes

## Total internal reflection
When light passes from an optically dense medium to a lesser one, and the angle ($\theta_c$) is great enough, the light undergoes total internal reflection and doesn't pass into the second medium
$$ \sin \theta_c = \dfrac{n_2}{n_1} $$
