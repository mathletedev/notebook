> Repeated motion

## Parts of a wave
- Displacement $\Delta x$ - distance from equilibrium
- Amplitude $A$ - maximum displacement from equilibrium
- Wavelength $\lambda$ - length (in meters) of one full cycle
- Crest - top of the wave
- Trough - bottom of the wave
- Period $T$ - length (in seconds) of one full cycle
- Frequency $f$ number of full cycles per second
