> How [[light]] bends as it passes through different mediums

## Index of refraction
- How we compare the speed of light in different media
- Light's frequency when passing into different media is unaltered; wavelength changes
$$ n = \dfrac{c}{v} = \dfrac{\lambda}{\lambda_m} $$

## Snell's Law
$$ n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2 $$
