> Bending of a [[wave]] around an edge

When [[light]] waves diffract around edges, they interfere constructively and destructively

$$ m = \frac{\Delta L}{\lambda} $$
$m$: order number
$\Delta L$: difference between distances from axes and point
$\lambda$: wavelength

## Single/Double slit experiment
$$ \Delta L = d \sin \theta = m \lambda $$
$d$: slit width (single slit) or distance between slits (double slit)
$\theta$: angle between axis and point
$m$: order number

Integer order numbers are where waves constructively interfere

$$ y = \frac{mL \lambda}{d} $$
$y$: distance between fringes (white lines / black lines)
