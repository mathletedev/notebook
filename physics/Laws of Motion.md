# First Law
An object in motion will start in motion unless acted upon by an outside force
Also known as *inertia*

# Second Law
The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to it's mass
$$ F = ma $$
F: [[force]] in Newtons
m: mass in kilograms
a = [[acceleration]] in m/s^2

# Third Law
Every force has an equal and opposite reaction

### Third Law pair
A pair of opposing forces
