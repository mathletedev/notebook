> The [[force]] of support a plane supplies, perpendicular to its surface

- If the object is not perpendicular to the force of gravity, rotate the axes so the normal force is pointing up (refer to [[Gravity & Weight]])
- Break the force of gravity into components to calculate the normal force

$$ N = W cos \theta $$
Where theta is the angle of elevation of the plane
