> Potential energy stored in difference between [[charge]]s

$$ \Delta U_e = q \Delta V $$
$q$: charge of the source
$\Delta V$: electric potential difference (volts)

Where
$$ V = \frac{kq}{r} $$

- Positive charges have "high" potential, negative charges have "low" potential
- Positive charges accelerate towards negative ones
