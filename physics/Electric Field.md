> The influence a [[charge]]d object has on other charges

$$ E = \frac{kq}{r^2} $$

*Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential lines*

## Parallel plates
When two plates are parallel to each other and have different charges, the uniform charge distribution across them results in a uniform field between them

$$ E = \frac{4 \pi kQ}{A} $$
$A$: area of plates
