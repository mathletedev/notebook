Velocity is measured in *meters per second* (m/s)

Speed is a [[scalar]] quantity

$$ s = d / t $$

Velocity is a [[vector]] quantity; it describes direction

$$ v = \Delta x / t $$

# Examples
	Distance to school: 500 m
	Displacement: 400 m NE
	Time: 5 min
	Find the speed and velocity of a trip to school

$$ s = 500m / 5min = 100m / min = 6000 m/hour = 6 km/h $$
$$ v = 400mNE / 5min = 80mNE / min = 4800mNE / hour = 4.8 km/hour NE $$

> *Never* average speeds
> Always use total distance / total time!
