[[Acceleration]] describes change in velocity
[[Velocity]] describes change in position

---

- Position-time graphs are the most complex
- Velocity-time graphs are less complex
- Acceleration-time graphs are the least complex

> Position can change when velocity is constant
> Velocity can change when acceleration is constant
