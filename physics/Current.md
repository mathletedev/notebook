**Current remains the same in series, but splits (possibly unevenly) in parallel**

Current is represented in *amperes* (A) - coulombs per second

$$ I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t} $$
$I$: current
$q$: charge
$t$: time

Realistically, current (electrons) flow from negative to positive, but conventionally, it goes from positive to negative
Also known as hole current, as the electrons leave a hole behind that travels the opposite way

Electrons actually travel really slowly (at the scale of mm/s)
However, they produce electric fields at speeds close to the speed of light!

## Types of current
**Direct current**: produced by batteries, only flows in one direction
**Alternating current**: seen in wall outlets, driven by alternating voltage (in the US, at a frequency of 60Hz)
