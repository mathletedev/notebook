> An object's motion relative to another object

# Organizing variables
	Imagine you are driving along the Moscow-Pullman High way at 55 mph relative to Earth. Another car flies past you going 70 mph relative to Earth. Does he appear to be going 70 mph to you in your frame of reference? What is his speed relative to your car?

Use the format
$$ v_{AB} $$
where *A* is the object and *B* is the observer

Let *A* be ourselves, *B* the other car, and *E* the Earth
$$ v_{AE} = 55mph $$
$$ v_{BE} = 70mph $$
$$ v_{BA} = 15mph $$

# Relative [[velocity]]
$$ v_{AB} = v_{AC} - v_{BC} $$

## Example
	Suppose a boat moves at 12.0 m/s relative to the water. If the boat is in a river with a current directed East at 2.50 m/s, what is the boatâ€™s speed relative to the shore when it is heading West?

Let *B* be the boat, *W* water, and *E* the Earth
$$ v_{BW} = -12m/s $$
$$ v_{WE} = 2.5m/s $$
$$ v_{BW} = v_{BE} - v_{WE} $$
$$ -12m/s = v_{BE} - 2.5m/s $$
$$ v_{BE} = -9.5m/s $$

---

What if the boat is heading East?
$$ v_{BW} = 12m/s $$
$$ v_{BE} = 14.5m/s $$
