> The energy in a moving object

$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 $$

# Derivation
$$ W = F \cdot \Delta x $$
$$ W = ma \cdot \Delta x $$

Using one of our previous kinetics equations,
$$ 2a \Delta x = v^2 - v_0^2 $$
$$ a \Delta x = \dfrac{v^2 - v_0^2}{2} $$

Substitute into the first equation:
$$ W = m (\dfrac{v^2 - v_0^2}{2}) $$
$$ W = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \frac{1}{2} mv_0^2 $$

This gives us
$$ W = F \cdot \Delta x = \Delta E_k $$

where
$$ E_k = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 $$
