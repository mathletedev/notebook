Resistance is measured in *Ohms* ($\Omega$)

$$ R = \rho \frac{l}{A} $$

## Resistors

### Series
$$ R_s = \sum_i R_i $$

### Parallel
Overall resistance of resistors in parallel is always less than the smallest resistor (always adds a new "path" for electricity to flow)

$$ \frac{1}{R_p} = \sum_i \frac{1}{R_i} $$
