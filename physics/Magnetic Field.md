$$ \vec{F} = q \vec{v} \cdot \vec{B} $$
$\vec{F}$: [[force]]
$q$: [[charge]]
$\vec{v}$: [[velocity]]
$\vec{B}$: magnetic field

Field strength is measured in *Teslas* (T)

## Modeling
Dots: directed towards observer
Crosses: directed away from observer

## Right hand rule
Pointer finger: direction of velocity
Middle finger: direction of field
Thumb: direction of force

Use left hand for a negative charge

## B-field strength
$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r} $$
$\mu_0$: $4 \pi \times 10^{-7} Tm/A$
$I$: [[current]]
$r$: distance from wire

## B-field in a coil
$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 NI}{2r} $$
$N$:  number of loops in the coil
$r$: radius of coil

## B-field in a solenoid
$$ B = \frac{\mu_0 NI}{l} $$
$l$: length of solenoid
