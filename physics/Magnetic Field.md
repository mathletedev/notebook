$$ \vec{F} = q \vec{v} \cdot \vec{B} $$
$\vec{F}$: [[force]]
$q$: [[charge]]
$\vec{v}$: [[velocity]]
$\vec{B}$: magnetic field

Field strength is measured in *Teslas* (T)

## Modeling
Dots: directed towards observer
Crosses: directed away from observer

## Right hand rule
Pointer finger: direction of velocity
Middle finger: direction of field
Thumb: direction of force
