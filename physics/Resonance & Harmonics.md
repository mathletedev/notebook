> Certain frequencies that cause [[standing waves]] to form

The first harmonic is also known as the *fundamental frequency*

## Wavelength
For the nth harmonic
$$ \lambda = \dfrac{2L}{n} $$
Where L is the length of the full wave

$v = \lambda f$, so
$$ v = \dfrac{2L}{n} f $$

## Possible frequencies
$$ f_n = \dfrac{v}{\lambda _n} $$
$$ = n (\dfrac{v}{2L}) $$
$$ = nf_1 $$

## Wave speed in a string
$$ v = \sqrt{\dfrac{F_t}{\mu}} $$
Ft: force of tension
mu: linear mass density

## Pipes

### Open pipe
$$ \lambda = \dfrac{2L}{n} $$
Where L is the length of the pipe

### Closed pipe
$$ \lambda = \dfrac{4L}{n} $$
