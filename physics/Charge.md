> Difference in protons/electrons

Opposite charges attract, same charges repel

Usually denoted by the variable $q$

All atoms have positive and negative charges
We can only move the valence electrons (outside the shell)

Charges has a tendency to balance itself out

## Constants
**Proton**: $1.60 \times 10^{-19} C$; $1.67 \times 10^{-27} kg$
**Electron**: $-1.60 \times 10^{-19} C$; $9.11 \times 10^{-31} kg$
Charge is in *Coulombs*

## Neutral objects
Neutral objects have a mix of charges. However, similar charges move towards the opposite end of the object, and opposite charges move towards the front of the object. That's why neutral objects attract all charges.

## Charging methods
- [[Friction]]: rubbing two materials together
- Conduction: flow of electrons when two things make contact

## Conductivity
- Conductors: valence electrons move freely (metals)
- Insulators: valence electrons are bound to their nucleus and don't move (wood, glass)
- Semiconductors: materials that are between metals/nonmetals that conduct electrons (silicon, germanium)
- Superconductor: perfect conductors only when below a certain temperature
