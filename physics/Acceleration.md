> Change in velocity over time

Acceleration is measured in *meters per second per second* (m/s^2)

$$ a = \Delta v / t $$

Is a [[vector]]

# Examples
	0 to 60 mph in 1.9 seconds

### Given
V0 = 0 mph
V = 60 mph
t = 1.9 s

### Unknown
a = ?

### Equation
$$ a = \Delta v / t $$

### Solve
$$ a = 26.8m/s / 1.9s $$
$$ a = 14.1053m/s^2 $$
