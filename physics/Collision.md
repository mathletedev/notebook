> When two objects contact, transfering [[kinetic energy]] and [[momentum]]

# Types

### Elastic
An elastic collision is when the colliding objects "bounce" back to their original shape after contact
Kinetic energy and momentum are conserved
Ex. when two pool balls hit each other

### Inelastic
An inelastic collision is when the colliding objects crumple
Kinetic energy is lost

#### Perfectly Inelastic
The two objects stick together when colliding
