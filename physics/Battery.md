> A device that stores chemical potential energy

**Cathode**: the positive terminal of the battery
**Anode**: the negative terminal of the battery

## Voltage
- Energy difference between battery terminals
- Measure of energy per charge (*J/C*)
- Represents the maximum voltage of a battery

## Symbol
Negative ──〢〢── Positive

## Battery ratings
Measured in amperes hours (A\*h); how long a battery lasts
$$ A * h = I * t $$
$I$: [[current]]
