> Weight is the [[force]] gravity exerts on a mass

# On Earth
$$ W = mg $$

## Example
	How much upward force would you need to apply to a 20 kg object to cause it to move with a constant velocity of 2 m/s?

Since acceleration is 0, the upward force has to cancel out
$$ F = 20kg (g) = 196N $$
So the upward force would have to be 196 N.

	What if you wanted to accelerate at 2m/s^2?

The net [[acceleration]] has to be 9.8 + 2 = 11.0m/s^2:
$$ F = 20kg (11.8m/s^2) = 236N $$

# In general
$$ F = G (m_1m_2) / r^2 $$
F: the force of gravity
G: the gravitational constant
m1 & m2: the two masses
r: the distance between the centers of the masses

$$ G = 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11} Nm^2/kg^2 $$
