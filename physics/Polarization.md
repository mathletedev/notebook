> How light passes through fine objects

## Diffraction gratings
Produce an interference pattern as light passes through a large number of small, parallel slits

Think about it like letting only "horizontal" or "vertical" light through

## Brewsler Angle
The angle at which light is totally reflected

$$ \theta_p = \tan^{-1} \frac{n_2}{n_1} $$
