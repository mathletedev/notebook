## Media effects theories

> Media effects theories provide different lenses through which researchers and scholars analyse how media content can influence individuals' attitudes, behaviours, and perceptions

1. **Agenda-Setting Theory**: Media don't tell people what to think but rather what to think about.
2. **Cultivation Theory**: Suggests that prolong exposure to media content can shape a person's perception of reality.
3. **Social Learning Theory**: Individuals learn behaviours, attitudes, values through observation and imitation - including those depicted in media.
4. **Uses & Gratification Theory**: People actively choose to use media for specific purposes and to satisfy certain psychological and social needs.
5. **Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: Suggests that exposure to conflicting or contradictory information can lead to cognitive discomfort.
6. **Dependency Theory**: Suggests that people (especially those who are isolated) become dependent on media for information and guidance. Media, then, gains power.
7. **Media Richness Theory**: Explores the capacity of different communication channels to convey information effectively.
8. **Spiral of Silence Theory**: People are hesitant to express opinions that they perceive as being in the minority - fearing social isolation or backlash.

### Example

Cognitive Dissonance Theory:
- Knowing you need to study for an upcoming test but still procrastinating
- Employees saying they like their jobs even though they don't
