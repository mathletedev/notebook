**Conglomerates**: Large corporations that own a significant percentage of media production, platforms, and pipes

## Vertical integration

> One owner buys all aspects of production and distribution of a single type of media product.

## Horizontal integration

> Process where one company buys different kinds of media, concentrating ownership across differing media types rather than up and down through one industry.

Conglomeration != success, but conglomerates are resilient.
