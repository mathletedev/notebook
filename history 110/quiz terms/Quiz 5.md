## Hessians

> The British Empire sent some 35,000 soldiers and half of its huge navy to suppress the American rebellion. The British also hired foreign soldiers (mercenaries), as some 30,000 German soldiers served in the British armies. Most were from the German state of Hesse-Cassel. Americans called them ***Hessians***.

## Citizen Soldiers

> While the Patriots had the advantage of fighting on their home ground, they also had to create an army and a navy from scratch. Before the war, **citizen-soldiers** (militiamen) were primarily civilians summoned from their farms and shops. During the Revolution, those called for military duty who had justifiable reasons could hire a substitute or simply pay a fine.

## Continental Army

> Washington knew that militiamen alone could not win the war. He therefore convinced the Continental Congress to create a **Continental Army** with full-time, well-trained soldiers. About half of the 200,000 Americans who served in the war were militiamen (Minutemen) and half were in the Continental Army. Most Continental Army recruits came from the margins of colonial society: poor farmers, unskilled labourers, indentured servants, or recently arrived immigrants. Most were young and single. Some 5,000 African Americans, virtually all formerly enslaved, also served.

## State Militias

> George Washington had learned some hard lessons. Dependence on state **militias**, he now realised, "would prove the downfall of our cause." The feisty frontier militiamen he had relied upon to bolster the Continental Army came and went as they pleased, in part because they resisted traditional forms of military discipline. Washington acknowledged that "a people unused to restraint must be led; they will not be driven."

## Battle of Trenton

> On a "fearfully cold and raw" Christmas night in 1776, Washington secretly led 2,400 men, packed into forty-foot-long boats and maintaining a "profound silence," across the ice-clogged Delaware River into New Jersey. Near sunrise at Trenton, the Americans surprised 1,500 sleeping Hessians, many of them hungover from too much Christmas rum. The **Battle of Trenton** was a total rout. Just two of Washington's men were killed, and only four wounded. The Americans captured a thousand prisoners, forty horses, six cannons, a thousand muskets, and forty barrels of rum, much of which was consumed immediately.

## Battles of Saratoga

> Burgoyne pulled his forces back to the village of Saratoga (now called Schuylerville), where the reinforced American army surrounded the British. In the ensuing three-week-long **Battles of Saratoga**, the British, desperate for food and ammunition, twice tried - and failed - to break through the encircling Americans, losing a third of their men in the process. On October 17, 1777, Burgoyne surrendered. "The fortunes of war," he told Gates, "have made me your prisoner." Burgoyne also turned over 5,800 troops, 7,000 muskets, and 42 cannons.
> The catastrophic British defeat unhinged King George. He fell "into agonies on hearing the account." The Saratoga campaign was the greatest loss that the British had ever suffered, and they would never recover. William Pitt, the former British prime minister, made a shocking prediction to Parliament after the defeat: *"You cannot conquer America."*

## Alliance with France

> The surprising victory at Saratoga was a strategic turning point for the new nation because it enabled an **alliance with France**, which was hungry for revenge after losing four wars to the British in the previous eighty years.
> In the end, the French intervention determined the outcome of the war.

## Valley Forge

> For the American army at **Valley Forge**, near Philadelphia, the winter of 1777-1778 was a time of intense suffering. Keeping his ragtag army intact and preserving morale was George Washington's greatest leadership test. He wrote Henry Laurens, the president of Congress, that he could not find words to convey their predicament. It "must be seen to be believed."
> The 11,000 Patriots, including some twelve-year-old soldiers accompanied by their mothers, lacked coats, shoes, and blankets. All were miserably hungry, and their 900 log-and-mud huts offered little protection from the icy winds. Bare feet froze, turned black, and were amputated.
> By February 1778, some 7,000 troops were too ill for duty, and horses were dying from starvation. The first soldier to die at Valley Forge was known simply as Jethro, one of the hundreds of free Blacks who served in the conflict. More than 2,500 soldiers died at Valley Forge; another 1,000 deserted, and several hundred officers resigned or left before winter's end. Washington warned Congress that if fresh food and supplies were not provided, the army would be forced "to starve, dissolve, or disperse."
> In the spring of 1778, British forces withdrew from Pennsylvania to New York City, with the American army in hot pursuit. From that time on, the combat in the north settled into a long stalemate.

## Battle of Yorktown

> The climactic **Battle of Yorktown** began on September 28. The American and French troops closed off Cornwallis's last escape route and began bombarding the British with cannons. Cornwallis held out for three grim weeks, but on October 17, 1781 - the anniversary of the American victory at Saratoga - he surrendered. Two days later, some 7,000 British soldiers laid down their weapons as the military band played "The World Turned Upside Down."

## Treaty of Paris (1783)

> In December 1781, King George decided against sending more troops to America. Early in 1782, British officials contacted Benjamin Franklin in Paris to ask if the Americans would be willing to sign a peace treaty without involving the French. Franklin replied that the United States had no intention of deserting its "noble" French ally to sign a treaty with "an unjust and cruel Enemy."
> On September 3, 1783, the warring nations signed the **Treaty of Paris**. Its provisions were surprisingly favourable to the United States. Great Britain recognised the independence of the thirteen former colonies and agreed that the Mississippi River was America's western boundary, thereby more than doubling the territory of the new nation and making the United States larger in size than any European nation. At a banquet celebrating the signing of the treaty, a French diplomat proposed a toast to the "growing greatness of America," now destined to become the "greatest empire in the world."

## Republican Ideology

> American Revolutionaries embraced a **republican ideology** instead of the aristocratic or monarchical outlook that had long dominated Europe. The new republic was not a democracy in the purest sense of the word. In ancient Greece, the Athenians had practised *direct democracy*, which meant that citizens voted on all major decisions affecting them. The United States, however, was technically a *representative democracy*, in which property-holding White men governed themselves through the concept of republicanism - they elected representatives, or legislators, to make decisions on their behalf. As Thomas Paine observed, representative democracy had many advantages over monarchies, one of which was greater transparency: "Whatever are its excellencies and defects, they are visible to all."

## State Constitutions

> To preserve the delicate balance between liberty and power, Revolutionary leaders believed that they must protect the rights of individuals and states from being violated by the national government. The war for independence thus sparked the crafting of **state constitutions** to support the new governments that were being created, all of which were designed to reflect the principles of the republican ideology, limiting government powers so as to protect the rights of the people.

## Articles of Confederation

> But it took five years for the squabbling states to ratify the **Articles of Confederation** (March 1781), in part because there was a war to wage and in part because local and state concerns trumped national needs.
> The states were in no mood to create a strong central government.

## Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom

> In 1776, the Virginia Declaration of Rights had guaranteed the free exercise of religion. Ten years later, the **Virginia Statute of Religious Freedom** (written by Thomas Jefferson) declared that "no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place or ministry whatsoever" and "that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion." These statutes, and the Revolutionary ideology that justified them, helped shape the course that religious life would take in the United States: diverse and voluntary rather than monolithic and enforced by the government.
