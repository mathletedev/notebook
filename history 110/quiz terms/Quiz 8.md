## Market Economy

> Now, however, “no farmer could find it profitable to do everything for himself. He now sells for money.” With the cash they earned, farm families were able to buy more land, better equipment, and the latest manufactured household goods.

> What the market economy most needed were “internal improvements” — deeper harbors, lighthouses, and a national network of canals, bridges, roads, and railroads—to improve the flow of goods across states.

> Such large-scale commercial agriculture, the first stage of a **market economy**, produced boom-and-bust cycles, and was often built upon the backs of enslaved laborers, immigrant workers, and displaced Mexicans.

## Steamboats

> Thereafter, the use of wood-fired **steamboats** spread rapidly. By bringing two-way travel to the rivers in the Mississippi Valley, steamboats created a transcontinental market and a commercial agricultural empire that produced much of the nation’s cotton, timber, wheat, corn, cattle, and hogs.

## Erie Canal

> The **Erie Canal** (finished in 1825) in central New York connected the Great Lakes and the Midwest to the Hudson River and New York City.

> A “river of gold” flowed along the Erie Canal after it opened in 1825. It drew eastward much of the midwestern trade (furs, lumber, textiles) that earlier had been forced to go to Canada or make the long journey down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico. Thanks to the Erie Canal, the backwoods village of Chicago developed into a bustling city because of its commercial connection via the Great Lakes to New York City, and eventually to Europe.

## Railroads

> During the second quarter of the nineteenth century, a more versatile and powerful form of transportation emerged: the **railroad**. In 1825, the year the Erie Canal was completed, the world’s first steam-powered railway began operating in England. Soon thereafter, a railroad-building craze struck the United States. In 1830, the nation had only 23 miles of railroad track. Over the next twenty years, railroad coverage grew to 30,626 miles.

> The railroad surpassed other forms of transportation because trains could carry more people and freight faster, farther, and cheaper. The early railroads averaged ten miles per hour, more than twice the speed of stagecoaches and four times that of boats and barges. Railroads could also operate year-round, which gave them a huge advantage over canals that froze over in winter and dirt roads that became rivers of mud during rainstorms.

> Building railroads stimulated the national economy not only by improving transportation but also by creating a huge demand for iron, wooden cross-ties, bridges, locomotives, freight cars, and other equipment. Railroads also became the nation’s largest corporations and employers.

## Clipper Ships

> Built for speed, the **clipper ships** were the nineteenth-century equivalent of the supersonic jetliner. The three-masted schooners were twice as fast as the older merchant ships. Long and lean, with sleek hulls, flat bottoms, taller masts, and more sails, they cut dashing figures during their brief but colorful career, which lasted less than two decades.

> The American thirst for Chinese tea prompted the clipper boom. Asian tea leaves had to reach the market quickly after harvest, and the clipper ships made this possible. In addition, smugglers needed fast ships to get opium from India to China and then to America. A clipper ship loaded with opium was worth tens of millions of dollars at today’s rates.

## Telegraph System

> Samuel F. B. Morse, a portrait-painter-turned-inventor, developed the telegraph. In May 1844, he sent the first intercity telegraph message from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland. It read: “What hath God wrought?” By the end of the 1840s, most major cities benefited from telegraph lines.

> By enabling people to communicate faster and more easily across long distances, the telegraph system triggered many changes, not the least of which was helping railroad operators schedule trains more precisely and thus avoid collisions. A New Orleans newspaper claimed that with the invention of the telegraph “scarcely anything now will appear to be impossible.”

## Industrial Revolution

> The **Industrial Revolution**, centred on the invention of the steam engine, was the most important development in human history since the advent of agriculture. Prior to 1800, most products were made by hand by skilled artisans. That changed quickly with the development of textile machinery, soon followed by a dazzling array of machinery invented to manufacture almost everything.

> Factories, mills, mines, and industrial plants emerged to replace many artisans and craftsmen making clothing, shoes, clocks and watches, furniture, firearms, and an array of other items.

## Cotton Gin

> Within just ten days, Whitney had devised “an absurdly simple contrivance,” using nails attached to a roller, to remove the seeds from cotton bolls.

> Completed in 1793, Whitney’s cotton gin (short for engine) proved to be fifty times more productive than a hand labourer. Almost overnight, it transformed cotton from simply a local crop to a global industry led by the American South, whose climate from Virginia southward offered the 200 frost-free days required to grow the fibrous plant. In becoming America’s most profitable crop, cotton transformed southern agriculture, northern industry, race-based slavery, national politics, and international trade.

## McCormick Reaper

> In 1831, twenty-two-year-old Virginian Cyrus Hall McCormick invented a mechanical reaper pulled by horses to harvest wheat, a development as significant to the agricultural economy of the Midwest, Old Northwest, and Great Plains as the cotton gin was to the South.

> In 1847, the McCormick reaper began selling so fast that its inventor moved to Chicago and built a manufacturing plant. Within a few years, McCormick had sold thousands of the giant machines, transforming the scale of commercial agriculture. Using a handheld sickle, a farmer could harvest a half-acre of wheat a day; with a McCormick reaper, two people could work twelve acres a day.

## Lowell System

> In 1822, the Boston Associates, led by Francis Cabot Lowell, developed another cotton mill at a village along the Merrimack River twenty-eight miles north of Boston, which they renamed Lowell. It soon became the model for mill towns throughout New England, often referred to as the **Lowell system**.

> The founders of the Lowell system sought to develop ideal industrial communities. To avoid the wretched conditions of the overcrowded English textile-mill villages, they located their four- and five-story brick-built mills along rivers in the countryside and lined the streets with trees and tidy flower beds.

## Nativists

> Not all Americans welcomed the flood of immigrants. A growing number of “nativists” sought to restrict or stop immigration altogether. The flood of Irish and German Catholics especially aroused hostility among Protestant nativists. A Boston minister described Catholicism as “the ally of tyranny, the opponent of material prosperity, the foe of thrift, the enemy of the railroad, the caucus, and the school.”

## Know-Nothings

> The Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, founded in New York City in 1849, grew into a powerful political group known officially as the American party. Members pledged never to vote for any foreign-born or Catholic candidates. When asked about the secretive organization, they were told to say, “I know nothing,” a phrase that gave rise to the informal name for the American party: the **Know-Nothings**.

## National Trades' Union

> Until the 1820s, labour organisations took the form of local trade unions, each confined to one city and one craft or skill. From 1827 to 1837, however, organisation on a larger scale began to take hold. In 1834, the National Trades’ Union was formed to organize the citywide trade unions into a stronger national association.

## Professions

> The dramatic social changes of the first half of the nineteenth century opened up an array of new **professions**. Bustling new towns required new services - retail stores, printing shops, post offices, newspapers, schools, banks, law firms, medical practices, and others — that created more high-status professions than had existed before.
