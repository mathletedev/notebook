## Peculiar Institution

> Most southern Whites did not own enslaved people, but everyone was affected by the social norms and economic imperatives of what southern leaders euphemistically referred to as the South’s “**peculiar institution**” of enslaved labour.

> Most southerners viewed those held in bondage not as human beings but as investment property. A South Carolina planter asserted that the enslaved “are yet the best stock a man can own. ...The truth is there is no investment so safe & so profitable as land & negroes.” The profitability and convenience of owning labourers created a sense of social unity among Whites that bridged class differences. Poor Whites who owned no enslaved people and resented the planters (referred to as cotton snobs) could still claim racial superiority over enslaved Blacks. Because of race-based slavery, explained Georgia attorney Thomas Reade Cobb, every White “feels that he belongs to an elevated class. It matters not that he is no slaveholder; he is not of the inferior race; he is a free-born citizen.

## Old Southwest

> As Virginia and the Carolinas experienced soil exhaustion from the overplanting of tobacco and cotton, restless farmers and many sons of planters moved to the **Old Southwest** - western Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and, eventually, Texas. They found cheap land and fertile soil - a promised land made possible by the worldwide demand for cotton clothing.

## Cotton Kingdom

> By 1860, the centre of the “**cotton kingdom**” stretched from eastern North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia through the Alabama-Mississippi “black belt” (so called for the colour of the fertile soil), through Louisiana, on to Texas, and up the Mississippi River Valley as far as southern Illinois.

## Planters

> The large planters behaved like aristocrats, controlling political, economic, and social life, in part because of self-interest and in part because they assumed they were the region’s natural leaders

> If, as historians have agreed, one had to own at least twenty labourers to be called a **planter**, only 1 out of 30 Whites in 1860 qualified.

## Plantation Mistress

> White wives and children, he stressed, needed to be as subservient and compliant as enslaved Blacks were required to be.

> The **plantation mistress** may have been expected to be meekly submissive, but few were the frail, helpless creatures that many husbands demanded. Although wives had enslaved people to attend to their needs, she supervised the domestic household in the same way that planters took care of the cotton business. Wives oversaw the supply and preparation of food and linens, the housecleaning and care of the sick, the birthing of babies, and the operations of the dairy. An enslaved plantation worker remembered that her mistress “was with all the slave women every time a baby was born. Or, when a plague of misery hit the folks, she knew what to do and what kind of medicine to chase off the aches and pains.” At the same time, however, southern women often treated enslaved workers harshly. South Carolinian Martha Burt, the niece of John C. Calhoun’s older brother, was notorious for “always scolding and whipping” her enslaved people.

## Plain White Folk

> The most numerous White southerners were small farmers - the “**plain white folk**,” usually uneducated and often illiterate, eking out hardscrabble lives of bare self-sufficiency. These small farmers (“yeomen”) lived with their families in two-room cabins, raised a few hogs and chickens, grew some corn and cotton, and traded with neighbours more than they bought from stores.

## Slave Codes

> During the 1660s, colonial legislatures formalised the institution of race-based slavery, with detailed **slave codes** regulating most aspects of enslaved people’s lives. The South Carolina code, for example, defined all “Negroes, Mulattoes, and Indians” sold into bondage as having become enslaved for life, as were the children born of enslaved mothers.

## Mulattoes

> Among the free Black population were **Mulattoes**, people of mixed ancestry. The 1860 census reported 412,000 Mulattoes in the United States, or about 10 percent of the Black population - probably a drastic undercount. In cities such as Charleston, and especially New Orleans, “coloured” society occupied a status somewhere between that of Blacks and that of Whites. Although most free people of colour were poor, some Mulattoes built substantial fortunes and even became slaveholders themselves.

## Field Hands

> Although many enslaved people were artisans or craftsmen (carpenters, blacksmiths, furniture makers, butchers, ship pilots, house servants, cooks, nurses, maids, weavers, basketmakers, etc.), the vast majority were **field hands** who were often organised into work gangs supervised by a Black driver or White overseer. Some enslaved people were “hired out” to other planters or to merchants, churches, or businesses. Others worked on Sundays or holidays to earn cash of their own.

## Spirituals

> Enslaved African Americans were victims of terrible injustice and abuse, but such an obvious truth neglects important evidence of their endurance, resilience, and achievement.

> Wherever they could, they forged their own sense of community, asserted their individuality, and devised ingenious ways of resisting their confinement.

> Many **spirituals** (sacred folk songs) expressed a longing to be free. Although most enslaved people were prohibited from marrying, the law did not prevent them from choosing partners and forging a family life within the rigid constraints of slavery.

## Nat Turner's Rebellion

> The Nat Turner rebellion of August 1831, in Southampton County, Virginia, again panicked Whites throughout the South. Turner, a trusted Black overseer, was also a preacher who believed God had instructed him to lead a slave rebellion. The revolt began when a small group of enslaved people joined Turner in killing his owner’s family. Arming themselves with axes and swords, farm tools and muskets, they then repeated the process at other farmhouses, where other enslaved people joined in. Before the revolt ended, fifty-seven Whites had been killed, most of them women and children. Turner later explained that he had also killed the “man who was to me a kind master.”

> Federal troops, Virginia militiamen, and volunteers, driven by anger and fear, indiscriminately killed nearly 200 enslaved people in the process of putting down the rebels. Seventeen enslaved people were hanged; several were decapitated, and their severed heads placed on poles along the highway. Turner, called the “blood-stained monster,” avoided capture for six weeks. He then was tried and found guilty. While waiting to be hanged, he was asked if the revolt was worth it. “Was not Christ crucified?” he replied. His dead body was dismembered, with body parts given to the victims’ families.

> More than any other slave uprising, **Nat Turner’s Rebellion** terrified Whites across the South. The Virginia legislature debated whether slavery should be abolished. That proposal was defeated, and instead the delegates restricted the ability of enslaved people to learn to read and write and gather for religious meetings.

## Denmark Vesey

> The Denmark Vesey plot in Charleston, South Carolina, discovered in 1822, involved a similar effort to assault the White population. Vesey, born in 1767 on the Caribbean island of St. Thomas, was bought by a slave trader based in Charleston. In 1799, Vesey purchased a lottery ticket and won $1,500, which he used to buy his freedom.

> In 1822, Vesey and several others developed a plan for a massive slave revolt. They would first capture the city’s arsenal and distribute its hundreds of rifles to free and enslaved Blacks, who outnumbered Whites in the city. All the Whites would then be killed, along with any Blacks who refused to join the rebellion. Vesey then planned to burn the city, seize ships in the harbour, and head for the Black republic of Haiti...

> The Vesey plot never got off the ground, however. As Vesey and others secretly tried to recruit enslaved people, one of them told his master what was going on. Soon Vesey and a hundred other supposed rebels were captured and tried. The court found Vesey guilty of plotting a slave uprising intended to “trample on all laws, human and divine; to riot in blood, outrage, rapine ... and conflagration, and to introduce anarchy and confusion in their most horrid forms.” Vesey and thirty-four others were executed; three dozen more were transported to Spanish Cuba and sold. When told that he would be hanged, Vesey replied that “the work of insurrection will go on.”

> Denmark Vesey’s planned rebellion led officials in South Carolina to place even more restrictions on the mobility of free Blacks and Black religious gatherings. It also influenced John C. Calhoun to abandon the nationalism of his early political career and become the South’s most forceful spokesman for states’ rights.

## Mary Boykin Chesnut

> Mary Boykin Chesnut, a plantation mistress in South Carolina, complained that “there is no slave, after all, like a wife.” She admitted that she had few rights, since her husband was the “master of the house.” George Fitzhugh, a Virginia attorney and writer, spoke for most southern men when he said that a “man loves his children because they are weak, helpless, and dependent. He loves his wife for similar reasons.”

## Celia

> Enslaved people often could improve their circumstances only by making horrible choices that offered no guarantee of success. The tragic story of a girl named Celia reveals the moral complexity of slavery for African American women and the limited legal options available to them.

> In 1850, fourteen-year-old Celia was purchased by Robert Newsom, a prosperous Missouri farmer who told his daughters that he had bought the girl to be their servant. In fact, however, the recently widowed Newsom wanted a sex slave. After purchasing Celia, he raped her, and for the next five years treated her as his mistress, even building her a brick cabin fifty yards from his house. During that time, she gave birth to two of his children

> Eventually, Celia reached her breaking point. She warned Newsom that the rapes must stop. He paid no attention. On June 23, 1855, the sixty-five-year-old Newsom entered Celia’s cabin, ignored her frantic appeals, and kept assaulting her until she struck and killed him with a large stick and then burned his body in the fireplace.

> Celia was not allowed to testify at her murder trial because she was an enslaved person. The judge and jury, all White men, pronounced her guilty, and on December 21, 1855, she was taken to the Calloway Courthouse in Fulton, Missouri, and “hanged until she died.”

> Celia’s grim story illustrates the lopsided power structure in southern society at the time. She bore a double burden, being both an enslaved person and a woman living in a male-dominated society rife with racism and sexism.
