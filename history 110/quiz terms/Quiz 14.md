## Anaconda Plan

**Battle of Bull Run**: Complete mess, with Confederacy victory

> The Battle of Bull Run demonstrated that the war would not be decided with one sudden stroke, as many had assumed. General Winfield Scott, the seventy-five-year-old commander of the Union effort, devised a three-pronged strategy. First, the Army of the Potomac, the main Union army, would defend Washington, D.C., and exert constant pressure on the Confederate capital at Richmond.

> Second, the Federal navy’s blockade of southern ports would cut off the Confederacy’s access to foreign goods and weapons. The third component called for other Union armies to divide the Confederacy by pushing south along the crucial inland water routes: the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland Rivers. This so-called **Anaconda Plan** was intended to slowly trap and crush the southern resistance, like an anaconda snake strangling its prey.

## Contrabands

> The expanding war forced the issue of the status of slavery. As Federal forces pushed into the Confederacy, freedom seekers began arriving in Union army camps needing food and shelter. Initially, commanders did not know what to do with them—or what to call them. Were they “freedmen” or “vagrants” or something else? One general designated them as “contraband of war,” a military phrase referring to captured military equipment. Thereafter, the eventual half million enslaved people who arrived at Union army camps seeking protection and freedom were known as **contrabands**, but the more accurate term for them was *refugees*.

## Battle of Antietam

> Robert E. Lee made his own momentous decision in the summer of 1862: He would invade Maryland and force the “much weakened and demoralised” Army of the Potomac and its “timid” commander George McClellan to leave northern Virginia, thereby relieving the pressure on Richmond, the Confederate capital. “The idea of waiting for blows, instead of inflicting them, is altogether unsuited to the genius of our people,” explained the Richmond Examiner.

> On September 17, Union and Confederate armies clashed in the furious **Battle of Antietam** (Sharpsburg). Had Union soldiers not discovered Lee’s battle plans wrapped around three cigars that a Rebel courier had carelessly dropped on the ground, the Confederates might have won.

> There, over the course of fourteen hours, the poorly coordinated Union army launched repeated attacks. The fighting was savage; a Union officer counted “hundreds of dead bodies lying in rows and in piles.” The scene after “five hours of continuous slaughter” was “sickening, harrowing, horrible. O what a terrible sight!” With nearly 23,000 killed and wounded on both sides, it was *the bloodiest single day of the war and the bloodiest day in American history*.

Technically a draw, but attacking Confederates retreated.
McClellan didn't pursue the Confederates and was removed from commander position.

## The Emancipation Proclamation

> On September 22, 1862, five days after the Battle of Antietam, President Lincoln issued the preliminary **Emancipation Proclamation**, which changed the course of history. It warned Confederate leaders that if they did not stop fighting and return to the Union, all enslaved people still under their control would be made “forever free” in exactly 100 days, on January 1, 1863.

> The Emancipation Proclamation was not based on ideas of racial equality or abstract ideals of human dignity. It was, according to Lincoln, a “military necessity” and therefore a legitimate use of presidential “war powers.” His concept of military-necessitated emancipation would free only those enslaved in areas still controlled by the Confederacy; it had no bearing on those enslaved in the four border states because they remained in the Union, and Lincoln had no constitutional authority to free them.

## Militia Act, 1862

> In July 1862, in an effort to strengthen the Union war effort, the U.S. Congress had passed the **Militia Act**, which authorised the army to use formerly enslaved people as labourers or soldiers. (They were already eligible to serve in the navy.) Lincoln, however, did not encourage their use as soldiers because he feared the reaction in the border states, where slavery remained in place. Only after the formal signing of the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 did the Union army recruit Black soldiers in large numbers. Doing so represented the most revolutionary episode of the war.

## Pacific Railway Act, 1862

> Republicans in Congress, with Lincoln’s support, enacted legislation reflecting their belief that the federal government should actively promote economic development. To that end, Congress approved the **Pacific Railway Act (1862)**, which provided funding and grants of land for construction of a 1,900-mile-long transcontinental railroad line from Omaha, Nebraska, to Sacramento, California.

## Homestead Act, 1862

> In addition, a **Homestead Act (1862)** granted 160 acres of public land to each settler who agreed to work the land for five years. To help farmers become more productive, Congress created a new federal agency, the Department of Agriculture.

## Morrill Land-Grant College Act, 1862

> Two other key pieces of legislation were the **Morrill Land-Grant College Act (1862)**, which provided states with 30,000 acres of federal land to finance the establishment of public universities that would teach “agriculture and mechanic arts,”...

## National Banking Act, 1863

> ...and the **National Banking Act (1863)**, which created national banks that could issue paper money that would be accepted across the country. These wartime measures had long-term significance for the growth of the national economy—and the expansion of the federal government.

## Battle of Vicksburg, 1863

> While General Lee frustrated the Federals in the East, General Grant had been inching his army down the Mississippi River toward the Confederate stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi, a busy commercial town situated on high bluffs overlooking a bend in the river. Capturing the most important Rebel outpost in the western theatre, Grant stressed, “was of the first importance,” because Vicksburg was the only rail and river junction between Memphis, Tennessee, and New Orleans. By gaining control of the lower Mississippi River, the Union could cut off and isolate Texas, Arkansas, and most of Louisiana from the rest of the Confederacy.

> One of Grant’s generals declared that “no place on earth is favoured by nature with natural defence such as Vicksburg.”

> In the **Battle of Vicksburg**, Grant decided to use constant bombardment from gunboats and cannons to starve and gradually wear down the trapped Confederate soldiers, 10 percent of whom would be killed or wounded. Many civilians were forced to live in cellars or caves dug as protection from the unending shelling. A woman trapped by the siege stressed that “we are utterly cutoff from the world, surrounded by a circle of fire. The fiery shower of [Union] shells goes on day and night.” All the “dogs and cats must be killed or starved. I don’t see any more pitiful animals prowling around.”

Soldiers pleaded for surrender, but Commander Pemberton wanted to outlast Grant.
Asked General Lee to help break up siege.

## Battle of Gettysburg, 1863

> Vicksburg’s dilemma led Jefferson Davis to ask General Lee to send troops from Virginia to Mississippi to break the Union siege. Lee, however, thought he had a better plan. He would make another daring strike into the North in hopes of forcing the Union army surrounding Vicksburg to rush home to defend the Northern heartland. He also wagered that a bold northern offensive would persuade peace-seeking Democrats to try again to end the war on terms favourable to the Confederacy. The stakes were high. A Confederate general said the invasion across Maryland and into Pennsylvania would “either destroy the Yankees or bring them to terms.” Or be a disaster for Lee.

General Stuart broke off from Lee to threaten Washington, D.C.
General Meade realised the Confederates were going to attack, so he chased them.

> Neither side expected Gettysburg, a hilly farming town in southeastern Pennsylvania, to be the site of the largest battle ever fought in North America. Unsuspecting Confederate troops entered the town at dawn on June 30 and collided with Union cavalry units that had been tracking their movements.

> The main forces of both sides - 65,000 Confederates and 85,000 Federals - then raced to the scene, and on July 1, the armies clashed in what came to be called the **Battle of Gettysburg**, the most dramatic contest of the war.

Federals were initially forced to retreat, but Confederates could never break through.

General Lee decided to perform a full assault, with no success.

General Pickett then told his men to charge, and was bombarded with 120 Union cannons and thousands of riflemen. Half of the Confederates were killed or wounded.

> With stunning suddenness, the carnage was over. The surviving Confederates retreated to the sheltering woods, and the once roaring battlefield was left covered with the corpses of men and horses, a scene made ghastlier by the “moanings and groanings” of thousands of wounded. Each corpse told a poignant story. Scattered beside a dead Federal officer were papers granting him leave to go home and be married, and a letter from his soon-to-be bride expressing her “happiness at the approaching event.”

Union claimed victory and Lee retreated. Again, General Meade did not pursue, and Lincoln was outraged.

Siege of Vicksburg was also successful because of this.

## The Election of 1864

General Sherman went to Atlanta, Georgia and was met by General Hood. Hood was on the offensive but suffered many casualties. Sherman took over Atlanta and drove Confederates out.

> William Tecumseh Sherman’s conquest of Atlanta enabled Abraham Lincoln to win a second term in the **election of 1864**. Up to that point, the president was convinced that he would lose. “I am a beaten man, unless we have some great victory,” he predicted at the end of August. Now, the tide had turned in Lincoln’s favour. As a Republican senator said, the Union victory in Georgia “created the most extraordinary change in public opinion here [in the North] that ever was known.” A Union newspaper editor reported that the fall of Atlanta “has secured a sudden unanimity for Mr. Lincoln.

## Sherman's March to the Sea

> On November 15, 1864, Sherman’s army also began its 300-mile March to the Sea, racing southeastward across Georgia from Atlanta to coastal Savannah, living off the land while destroying plantations, barns, crops, warehouses, mills, bridges, and rail lines. An Ohio sergeant told his men, “Every house, barn, fence, and cotton gin gets an application of the torch. That prospect is revolting, but war is an uncivil game, and can’t be civilised.”

> **Sherman’s “March to the Sea”** became infamous among Southerners as a supposed example of Union ruthlessness. After the war, however, a Confederate officer acknowledged that the campaign was well-conceived and well-managed. “I don’t think there was ever an army in the world that would have behaved better, in a similar expedition, in an enemy country. Our army certainly wouldn’t have.”

## Appomattox Court House

> During the spring of 1865, General Grant’s army kept pounding the encircled Rebels defending Petersburg, Virginia. Robert E. Lee had no way to replace the men he was losing, and his dwindling army couldn’t kill enough Yankees to make Grant quit. On April 2, 1865, after General Philip Sheridan’s horse soldiers cut off the last railroad serving the Confederate army in Petersburg, a desperate Lee made a desperate decision: the badly outnumbered Confederates abandoned Petersburg and headed west, with the Union army in hot pursuit.

> At the same time, the Confederate government fled Richmond, but not before burning anything of value. While the fires raged, Union troops, led by the all-Black Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, entered the capital of the dying Confederacy. African Americans clogged the streets to welcome the soldiers. They shouted, danced, prayed, and sang songs of liberation. The next day, April 4, Abraham Lincoln toured the fallen Rebel capital. “The coloured population,” wrote a Black reporter for a Philadelphia newspaper, “went wild with excitement.”

> The Confederacy was in chaos. “Women were weeping, children crying,” noted a reporter in Richmond. “Men stood speechless, haggard, woebegone.” Five days later, on April 7, General Grant sent a note urging General Lee to surrender. With the remnants of his army virtually surrounded and no food, Lee recognised that “there is nothing left for me to do but go and see General Grant, and I would rather die a thousand deaths."

> On April 9 (Palm Sunday), four years to the day since the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, the tall, dignified Lee, stiff and formal in his impeccable dress uniform, ceremonial sword, and shiny boots, met the short, mud- spattered Grant in a small brick house in the village of **Appomattox Court House**. Grant apologised for his “rough” appearance, explaining that he had left behind his dress uniform. Lee, in turn, stressed that he was in a new uniform because it was the only one he had left, and he fully expected to be arrested after surrendering.

> After some awkward exchanges about their service as junior officers in the Mexican-American War, Lee asked Grant about the terms of surrender. In keeping with Lincoln’s desire for a gracious peace with “malice toward none,” a cigar-chewing Grant let the Confederates keep their pistols, horses, and mules, and he promised that none of them would be tried for treason. Lee replied that “this would have a most happy effect” upon his men and accepted the terms as “more than he expected.” He then confessed that his men were starving, and Grant ordered that they be provided food.

> Other unrepentant Confederates vowed revenge. John Wilkes Booth wrote in his diary that “something decisive and great must be done.” He began plotting with others to kill President Lincoln and members of his cabinet.

## The Thirteenth Amendment

> Three major steps occurred in January 1865. Missouri and then Tennessee abolished slavery, and, at Lincoln’s insistence, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an amendment to the Constitution that banned slavery everywhere. Every Republican voted in favour. As the final tally was announced, the House erupted in “an outburst of enthusiasm.” Men threw their hats and some “wept like children.”

> Upon ratification by three-fourths of the reunited states, the **Thirteenth Amendment** became law eight months after the war ended, on December 18, 1865. That date, said the New York Times, “will be forever memorable in the annals of the republic.” The amendment removed any lingering doubts about the legality of emancipation.
