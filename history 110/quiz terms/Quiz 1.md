## Guns, Germs, and Steel

Powerful horses with armored warriors terrified natives. Germs such as smallpox contributed heavily to the large number of deaths.

## Maize

> Indigenous peoples became expert at growing plants that would become the primary food crops of the hemisphere, chiefly **maize (corn)**, beans, and squash, but also chili peppers, avocados, and pumpkins.

> Maize-based societies viewed corn as the "gift of the gods" because it provided many essential needs. They made hominy by soaking dried kernels of corn in a mixture of water and ashes and then cooking it. They used corn cobs for fuel and the husks to fashion mats, masks, and dolls. They also ground the kernels into cornmeal, which could be mixed with beans to make protein-rich succotash.

## Mexicas

> During the thirteenth century, the nomadic **Mexicas** (Me-SHEE-kas) began drifting southward from northwest Mexico. (They were not called Aztecs until 1821, when Mexico gained its independence from Spain.) Disciplined and imaginative, the Mexicas seized control of the central highlands, where they built the spectacular city of Tenochtitlan (place of the stone cactus) on an island in Lake Tetzcoco, at the site of present-day Mexico City.

## Mexica Empire

> Tenochtitlan would become one of the grandest cities in the world. It served as the capital of a sophisticated **Mexica Empire** ruled by a powerful emperor and divided into two social classes: nobles, warriors, and priests (about 5 percent of the population), and the free commoners - merchants, artisans, farmers, and enslaved peoples.

> When the Spanish invaded Mexico in 1519, they found a vast Mexica Empire connected by a network of roads serving 371 city-states organised into 38 provinces. Towering stone temples, paved avenues, thriving marketplaces, and some 70,000 *adobe* (sunbaked mud) huts dominated Tenochtitlan

## Burial mounds

> The Adena-Hopewell cultures grew corn, squash, beans, and sunflowers, as well as tobacco for smoking. They left behind enormous earthworks and elaborate **burial mounds** shaped like snakes, birds, and other animals.

## Cahokia

> \[The Mississippians'] ability to grow large amounts of corn in the fertile flood plains spurred rapid population grown around regional centres. The largest of these advanced regional centres, called *chiefdoms*, was **Cahokia** (600-1300 C.E.), in southwest Illinois, near the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers (across from what is now St. Louis).

## Eastern woodland peoples

> After the collapse of Cahokia, the **Eastern Woodland peoples** spread along the Atlantic Seaboard from Maine to Florida and along the Gulf Coast to Louisiana. They included three groups distinguished by their different languages: the Algonquian, the Iroquoian, and the Muskogean. These were the indigenous societies that Europeans would first encounter when they arrived in North America.

## Columbus

> These were the circumstances that prompted Christopher Columbus's efforts to find a faster route to Japan and China. Born in the Italian seaport of Genoa, in 1451, Columbus took to the sea at an early age, teaching himself geography, navigation, and Latin. By the 1480s, he was eager to spread Christianity across the globe and win glory and riches for himself.

## Roman Catholicism

> The brutal efforts of the Spanish to convert native peoples in the Western Hemisphere to **Roman Catholicism** illustrated the murderous intensity with which European Christians embraced religious life. People fervently believed in heaven and hell, demons and angels, magic and miracles - and were willing to kill and die for their religious beliefs.

## Protestant Reformation

> The enforced unity of Catholic Europe began to crack on October 31, 1517, when an obscure, thirty-three-year-old German monk sent his ninety-five "theses" outlining the "corrupt" Catholic Church to church officials. Martin Luther (1483-1546) could not have known that his defiant stance and explosive charges would ignite history's fiercest spiritual drama, the **Protestant Reformation**.

## Conquistadors

> To prevent (Cortes's) soldiers, called **conquistadors** (conquerors), from deserting, Cortes ordered the Spanish ships burned. He spared only one vessel to carry the expected riches back to Spain.

## Encomienda

> To reward the conquistadors, the Spanish government transferred to America a medieval socioeconomic system known as the **encomienda**. Favoured soldiers or officials received large parcels of land - and control over people who lived there. The conquistadors were told to Christianise the Indians and provide them with protection in exchange for "tribute" - a share of their goods and forced labor.

## Columbian Exchange

> The European ships that crossed the Atlantic carried more than human cargo. They also brought plants and animals that set in motion what came to be called the **Columbian Exchange**, a worldwide transfer of plants, animals, and diseases, which ultimately worked in favour of the Europeans at the expense of the indigenous peoples.

## Infectious diseases

> The most significant aspect of the Columbian Exchange was the transmission of **infectious diseases**. Europeans and enslaved Native Americans brought to the Western Hemisphere deadly diseases that Native Americans had never encountered: smallpox, typhus, malaria, mumps, chickenpox, and measles. The results were catastrophic. By 1568, just seventy-five years after Columbus's first voyage, infectious diseases had killed 80 to 90 per-cent of the Indian population in the Western Hemisphere - the most significant loss of life in history.

## New Mexico

> The land that would later be called **New Mexico** was the first centre of Catholic missionary activity in the American Southwest.

## Spanish Armada

> Philip II, the king of Spain who was Elizabeth's brother-in-law and fiercest opponent, finally began plotting an invasion of England. To do so, he assembled the massive Spanish Armada: 132 warships, 7,000 sailors, and 17,000 soldiers. It was the greatest invasion fleet in history to that point.
