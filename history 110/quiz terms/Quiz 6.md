## The Northwest Ordinance

> Two years after passage of the Land Ordinance of 1785, the Confederation Congress passed the third major land policy: the **Northwest Ordinance** of 1787. It set forth two key principles: the new territories would eventually become coequal states, as Jefferson had proposed, and slavery would be banned from the region north of the Ohio River.

## Shays's Rebellion

Poor population in Massachusetts angry about new state constitution and taxes.

> Armed groups of angry farmers, calling themselves Regulators, or "the voice of the people," banded together to force judges and sheriffs to stop seizing the cattle and farms of those "debtors" who could not pay their taxes.

> The situation worsened when a ragtag "army" of unruly farmers led by thirty-nine-year-old Daniel Shays, a distinguished war veteran, marched on the federal arsenal at Springfield in the winter of 1787. The state government responded by sending 4,400 militiamen, who scattered the debtor army with a single cannon blast that left four farmers dead and many wounded. Shays fled to Vermont. Several rebels were arrested, and two were hanged. The rebels nevertheless earned a victory of sorts, as the legislature agreed to eliminate some of the taxes and fees.

## Federalism

> The delegates realised, too, that an effective national government needed authority to collect taxes, borrow and issue money, regulate commerce, fund an army and navy, and make laws. This meant that the states must be stripped of the power to print money, make treaties, wage war, and levy taxes and tariffs on imported goods. This concept of dividing authority between the national government and the states came to be called **federalism**.

## Separation of Powers

> The Great Compromise embedded the innovative concept of **separation of powers** into the new Congress. While James Madison believed that in "a republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates," he and others also sought to keep the Congress from becoming too powerful. To do so, they divided it into two houses, with the House of Representatives representing voters at large and the Senate representing state legislatures.

## Anti-Federalists

> Advocates for the Constitution took the name Federalists; opponents were called **anti-Federalists**. The two sides formed the seeds for America's first two-party political system.

Federalists had advantages:
- Draft Constitution
- Younger
- More unified and better organised

> Anti-Federalists feared that the new national government would eventually grow corrupt and tyrannical.

## The Federalist Papers

> Among the supreme legacies of the debate over the Constitution is what came to be called ***The Federalist Papers***, a collection of eighty-five essays published in New York newspapers in 1787 and 1788. Written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, the essays were intended to convince New Yorkers to ratify the new Constitution.

> The United States, according to *The Federalist Papers*, was to be a republic grounded in radically new notions: the people, not a king or queen, would be sovereign, and the rule of law would ensure that tyrants could never violate the civil rights protecting the citizenry.

## Jeffersonian Republicans

> With each passing year, the United States debated how to interpret and apply the provisions of the new Constitution. During the 1790s, the federal government would confront rebellions, states threatening to secede, international tensions, and foreign wars, as well as the formation of competing political parties - Federalists and Democratic Republicans, more commonly known as **Jeffersonian Republicans**, or simply as Republicans.

## Bill of Rights

> To address concerns raised by opponents of the new federal government, James Madison, now a congressman, presented to Congress a set of constitutional amendments intended to protect individual rights. After considerable debate, Congress approved twelve amendments in September 1789. By the end of 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had approved *ten* of the twelve proposed amendments, now known as the **Bill of Rights**.

> The Bill of Rights provided safeguards for individual rights of speech, assembly, religion, and the press; the right to own firearms; the right to refuse to house soldiers; protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; the right to refuse to testify against oneself; the right to a speedy public trial, with an attorney present, before an impartial jury; and protection against "cruel and unusual" punishments. The Tenth Amendment addressed the widespread demand that powers not delegated to the national government "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

## Bank of the United States

> The new **Bank of the United States** (B.U.S.) created in 1791, had three primary responsibilities: (1) to hold the government's revenues and pay its bills; (2) to provide loans to the federal government and to ----------------------- FINISH THIS -----------------------

## Jeffersonian-Hamiltonian Dichotomy

Jefferson -> democratic

- Looked up to France
- Liberal, experimental

- Looked up to Britain
- Conservative, slow-changing
