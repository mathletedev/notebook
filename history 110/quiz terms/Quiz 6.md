## The Northwest Ordinance

> Two years after passage of the Land Ordinance of 1785, the Confederation Congress passed the third major land policy: the **Northwest Ordinance** of 1787. It set forth two key principles: the new territories would eventually become coequal states, as Jefferson had proposed, and slavery would be banned from the region north of the Ohio River.

## Shays's Rebellion

Poor population in Massachusetts angry about new state constitution and taxes.

> Armed groups of angry farmers, calling themselves Regulators, or "the voice of the people," banded together to force judges and sheriffs to stop seizing the cattle and farms of those "debtors" who could not pay their taxes.

> The situation worsened when a ragtag "army" of unruly farmers led by thirty-nine-year-old Daniel Shays, a distinguished war veteran, marched on the federal arsenal at Springfield in the winter of 1787. The state government responded by sending 4,400 militiamen, who scattered the debtor army with a single cannon blast that left four farmers dead and many wounded. Shays fled to Vermont. Several rebels were arrested, and two were hanged. The rebels nevertheless earned a victory of sorts, as the legislature agreed to eliminate some of the taxes and fees.

## Federalism

> The delegates realised, too, that an effective national government needed authority to collect taxes, borrow and issue money, regulate commerce, fund an army and navy, and make laws. This meant that the states must be stripped of the power to print money, make treaties, wage war, and levy taxes and tariffs on imported goods. This concept of dividing authority between the national government and the states came to be called **federalism**.

## Separation of Powers

> The Great Compromise embedded the innovative concept of **separation of powers** into the new Congress. While James Madison believed that in "a republican government, the legislative authority necessarily predominates," he and others also sought to keep the Congress from becoming too powerful. To do so, they divided it into two houses, with the House of Representatives representing voters at large and the Senate representing state legislatures.

## Anti-Federalists

> Advocates for the Constitution took the name Federalists; opponents were called **anti-Federalists**. The two sides formed the seeds for America's first two-party political system.

Federalists had advantages:
- Draft Constitution
- Younger
- More unified and better organised

> Anti-Federalists feared that the new national government would eventually grow corrupt and tyrannical.

## The Federalist Papers

> Among the supreme legacies of the debate over the Constitution is what came to be called ***The Federalist Papers***, a collection of eighty-five essays published in New York newspapers in 1787 and 1788. Written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay, the essays were intended to convince New Yorkers to ratify the new Constitution.

> The United States, according to *The Federalist Papers*, was to be a republic grounded in radically new notions: the people, not a king or queen, would be sovereign, and the rule of law would ensure that tyrants could never violate the civil rights protecting the citizenry.

## Jeffersonian Republicans

> With each passing year, the United States debated how to interpret and apply the provisions of the new Constitution. During the 1790s, the federal government would confront rebellions, states threatening to secede, international tensions, and foreign wars, as well as the formation of competing political parties - Federalists and Democratic Republicans, more commonly known as **Jeffersonian Republicans**, or simply as Republicans.

## Bill of Rights

> To address concerns raised by opponents of the new federal government, James Madison, now a congressman, presented to Congress a set of constitutional amendments intended to protect individual rights. After considerable debate, Congress approved twelve amendments in September 1789. By the end of 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had approved *ten* of the twelve proposed amendments, now known as the **Bill of Rights**.

> The Bill of Rights provided safeguards for individual rights of speech, assembly, religion, and the press; the right to own firearms; the right to refuse to house soldiers; protection against unreasonable searches and seizures; the right to refuse to testify against oneself; the right to a speedy public trial, with an attorney present, before an impartial jury; and protection against "cruel and unusual" punishments. The Tenth Amendment addressed the widespread demand that powers not delegated to the national government "are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

## Bank of the United States

> The new **Bank of the United States** (B.U.S.) created in 1791, had three primary responsibilities: (1) to hold the government's revenues and pay its bills; (2) to provide loans to the federal government and to state-chartered banks to promote economic development; and (3) to manage the nation's money supply by regulating the power of state-chartered banks to issue paper currency or banknotes. The B.U.S. could issue national banknotes as needed to address the chronic shortage of gold and silver coins. Within a few years, the B.U.S. had added eight branches in major cities.

## French Revolution

> In July 1789, violence erupted in France when masses of the working poor, enraged over soaring prices for bread and in part inspired by the American Revolution, revolted against King Louis XVI.

> The French Revolution captured the imagination of many Americans, especially Jefferson and the Democratic Republicans, as royal tyranny was displaced by a democratic republic that gave voting rights to all adult men regardless of how much property they owned. Americans formed forty-two Democratic-Republican clubs that hosted rallies on behalf of the French Revolution.

Thomas Jefferson (Secretary of State) loved the French culture and democracy, and fully supported the French Revolution: the "tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."
Alexander Hamilton and John Adams saw the French Revolution as "vicious and godless", and sided with Great Britain. They called the Democratic Republicans "the French Party" and claimed they were "the curse of this country."

## Jay's Treaty

> In addition, as England and France engaged in warfare on land and sea, British warships violated international law by seizing hundreds of U.S. merchant ships sailing for a French port.

> Finally, Jay conceded that the British need not compensate U.S. citizens for the enslaved African Americans who had escaped to the safety of British armies during the Revolutionary War.

> In return for such concessions, Jay won three important promises: The British would (1) evacuate their six forts along the northwest frontier by 1796, (2) reimburse Americans for the seizures of ships and cargo in 1793-1794, and (3) grant U.S. merchants a limited right to trade again with the island colonies of the British West Indies.

> When the terms of **Jay's Treaty** were disclosed, many Americans, especially Republicans, were outraged. In Philadelphia, an angry crowd burned a copy of the treaty and an effigy of John Jay...

## Whiskey Rebellion

> The Washington administration faced another challenge in the backcountry when frontier farmers launched the so-called **Whiskey Rebellion (1794)**. Alexander Hamilton's 1971 tax on "distilled spirits" had ignited resistance among cash-poor farmers throughout the western frontier. Liquor made from grain or fruit was the region's most valuable product; it even was used as a form of currency... Beginning in September 1791, angry groups of farmers, militiamen, and labourers attacked federal tax collectors and marshals. In the summer of 1794, the discontent exploded into rebellion in western Pennsylvania, home to a fourth of the nation's whiskey stills. A mob of angry farmers threatened to assault nearby Pittsburgh, loot the homes of the rich, and set the town ablaze.

> The Whiskey Rebellion was the first great domestic challenge to the federal government, and George Washington responded decisively. At Hamilton's urging, Washington ordered the whiskey rebels ("enemies of order") to disperse by September 1 or he would sent in the militia.

## Alien and Sedition Acts

> Jefferson and other Republicans were convinced that the real purpose of the French crisis was to give Federalists an excuse to quiet their American critics. Legislation of the **Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798** confirmed republican suspicions. These partisan laws, passed amid a wave of patriotic war fervour, gave the president extraordinary powers to violate civil liberties protected by the Bill of Rights, all in a clumsy effort to stamp out criticism of the administration. They limited freedom of speech and of the press, as well as the liberty of "aliens" (immigrants who had not yet gained citizenship).

## Election of 1800

> Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, the Republican candidates, once again represented the alliance of the two most powerful states, Virginia and New York. A Federalist newspaper predicted that if the "godless" Jefferson were elected, "murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practised." Not to be outdone, a Republican newspaper dismissed Adams as a "blind, bald, crippled, toothless man who wants to start a war with France."

> In the **election of 1800**, Jefferson and Burr emerged with seventy-three electoral votes each. Adams received sixty-five. When Burr refused to withdraw in favour of Jefferson, the tie vote in the Electoral College required a deciding vote in the House of Representatives.

> After thirty-six ballots, a majority of House members chose Jefferson over Burr.

## Jeffersonian-Hamiltonian Dichotomy

Jefferson -> democratic
- Appealed to the common people
- Looked up to France
- Liberal, experimental

Hamilton -> republican
- Believed in "natural aristocracy": someone who had a larger "stake" in society would be better suited to lead
- Looked up to Britain
- Conservative, slow-changing
