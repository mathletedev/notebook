## The Northwest Ordinance

> Two years after passage of the Land Ordinance of 1785, the Confederation Congress passed the third major land policy: the **Northwest Ordinance** of 1787. It set forth two key principles: the new territories would eventually become coequal states, as Jefferson had proposed, and slavery would be banned from the region north of the Ohio River.

## Shays's Rebellion

Poor population in Massachusetts angry about new state constitution and taxes.

> Armed groups of angry farmers, calling themselves Regulators, or "the voice of the people," banded together to force judges and sheriffs to stop seizing the cattle and farms of those "debtors" who could not pay their taxes.

> The situation worsened when a ragtag "army" of unruly farmers led by thirty-nine-year-old Daniel Shays, a distinguished war veteran, marched on the federal arsenal at Springfield in the winter of 1787. The state government responded by sending 4,400 militiamen, who scattered the debtor army with a single cannon blast that left four farmers dead and many wounded. Shays fled to Vermont. Several rebels were arrested, and two were hanged. The rebels nevertheless earned a victory of sorts, as the legislature agreed to eliminate some of the taxes and fees.
