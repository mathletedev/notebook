## Bank War

> Early on, the president resolved to destroy the B.U.S., pledging “to put his foot upon the head of the monster and crush him to the dust.” The national bank may have become too powerful, but the **Bank War** between Jackson and Biddle revealed that the president never truly understood the bank’s role or policies. The national bank had provided a stable currency for the expanding economy, as well as a mechanism for controlling the pace of economic growth by regulating the ability of branch banks and state banks to issue paper currency.

## Tariff of Abominations

> Most South Carolinians blamed their economic woes on the Tariff of 1828, which they labelled the “**Tariff of Abominations**.” By taxing British textiles coming into U.S. markets, the 1828 tariff on imported cloth hurt southern cotton growers by reducing British demand for raw cotton from America. It also hurt southerners by raising the prices they had to pay for imports.

## Nullification

> In a lengthy pamphlet called the South Carolina Exposition and Protest (1828), written in secret by John C. Calhoun, the South Carolinian claimed that the Tariff of 1828 favoured the interests of New England textile manufacturing over southern agriculture. Under such circumstances, he argued, a state could “nullify,” or veto, a federal law it deemed unconstitutional. **Nullification** was the ultimate weapon for those determined to protect states’ rights against federal authority. As President Jackson and others pointed out, however, allowing states to pick and choose which federal laws they would follow would have created chaos.

## Force Bill

> President Jackson then sent federal soldiers and a warship to Charleston. Governor Hayne responded by mobilising the state militia, and the two sides verged on civil war. In early 1833, the president requested from Congress a “**Force Bill**” authorising him to use the U.S. Army to “force” compliance with federal law in South Carolina. Calhoun exploded on the Senate floor, exclaiming that he and others defending his state’s constitutional rights were being threatened “to have our throats cut, and those of our wives and children.” The greatest threat facing the nation, he argued, was not nullification but presidential despotism. Calhoun and the nullifiers, however, soon backed down, and the South Carolina legislature postponed implementation of the nullification ordinances in hopes that Congress would pass a more palatable tariff bill.

## Indian Removal Act

> In response to a request from Jackson, Congress in 1830 debated the **Indian Removal Act**, which authorised the president to ignore previous treaty commitments and force the 74,000 Indians remaining in the East and South to move to federal lands west of the Mississippi River—at the expense of the federal government.

## Distribution Act

> The surge of unstable paper money issued by state banks peaked in 1836, when events combined suddenly to destroy the value of the bank notes. Two key developments, the Distribution Act and the Specie Circular, would combine to play havoc with the economy and devastate the nation’s financial system.

> In June 1836, Congress approved a Deposit and Distribution Bill, initially proposed by Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, that required the federal government to “distribute” surplus revenue from land sales to the states by “depositing” the funds into eighty-one state banks in proportion to each state’s representation in Congress. The state governments would then draw upon those deposits to fund roads, bridges, and other internal improvements, including the construction of new public schools.

## Whig Party

> But in 1834, a new anti-Jackson coalition emerged, united chiefly by their hostility to the president’s authoritarian style. They claimed that he was ruling like a domineering monarch, dubbing him “King Andrew I,” and labeled his Democratic followers Tories. The new anti-Jackson coalition called itself the **Whig party**, a name that had been used by the Patriots of the American Revolution (as well as the parliamentary opponents of the Tories in Britain).

> The Whig party grew directly out of the National Republican party led by John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, and Daniel Webster. The Whigs also found support among Anti-Masons and even some Democrats who resented President Jackson’s war on the national bank. Of the forty-one Democrats in Congress who had voted against Jackson on rechartering the national bank, twenty-eight had joined the Whigs by 1836. For the next twenty years, the Whigs and the Democrats would be the two major political parties, and for a second time a two-party system emerged.

## Panic of 1837

> At his inauguration, Van Buren promised to follow “in the footsteps of President Jackson.” Before he could do so, however, the nation’s financial sector began collapsing. On May 10, 1837, several large state banks in New York, running out of gold and silver, suddenly refused to convert customers’ paper money into coins. Other banks across the nation quickly did the same. This financial crisis, the worst yet faced by the young nation, would become known as the **Panic of 1837**. It would soon mushroom into the republic’s worst depression, lasting some seven years.

## Independent Treasury Act

> Van Buren believed that the federal government should stop risking its deposits in shaky state banks. Instead, he wanted to establish an independent Treasury system whereby the government would keep its funds in its own bank vaults and do business entirely in gold or silver, not paper currency. Van Buren wanted the federal government to regulate the nation’s supply of gold and silver and let the marketplace regulate the supply of paper currency.

> It took Van Buren more than three years to convince Congress to pass the **Independent Treasury Act** on July 4, 1840. Although it lasted little more than a year (the Whigs repealed it in 1841), it would be restored in 1846. Not surprisingly, the state banks that lost control of the federal funds howled in protest.

## Peggy O'Neal

> Widower John Eaton, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee and one of Jackson’s closest friends, had long been associated with Margaret “Peggy” O’Neale Timberlake, an outspoken Washington woman married to John Timberlake, a naval officer frequently at sea. While her husband was away, she was involved with several “gentlemen,” including Senator John Eaton. In April 1828, John Timberlake died at sea. Although the official cause of death was pulmonary failure, rumours swirled that he had committed suicide after learning of his wife’s affair with Eaton.

> Jackson responded: “Marry her and you will be in a position to defend her.” Eaton did so on January 1, 1829. Eaton’s enemies quickly criticized the “unseemly haste” of the marriage and continued to demean Peggy Eaton.

> Intensely loyal to John Eaton, the president defended Peggy. His cabinet members, however, were unable to cure their wives of what Martin Van Buren dubbed “the Eaton Malaria.” The rumouring and sniping became a time-consuming distraction for the president.

> Martin Van Buren used the affair to curry favour with Jackson. As a widower, he was able to serve as Peggy Eaton’s escort at social events. He also accompanied Jackson on horse rides around the capital. In the process, he displaced Vice President Calhoun as the nation’s second most powerful political figure; he would become president himself in 1837.

## Trail of Tears

> In 1838, when Martin Van Buren was president, 17,000 Cherokees were evicted and moved west under military guard on the **Trail of Tears**, an 800-mile forced journey. Some 4,000 of the refugees, including John Ross’s wife, died along the way from exposure, disease, or starvation. Van Buren told Congress in December 1838 that he took “sincere pleasure” in reporting that the Cherokees had been relocated. “You can expel us by force, we grant,” Chief John Ross wrote to Van Buren in 1838, “but you cannot make us call it fairness.”
