## Joint Stock Companies

> Because few people were wealthy enough to finance a colony, those interested in colonisation banded together to share the financial risks. Investors purchased shares of stock in a colony to form **joint-stock companies**. That way, large amounts of money could be raised, and, if a colony failed, no investor would suffer the complete loss. If a colony succeeded, investors would share the profits.

## Middle Passage

> The transatlantic voyage of the slave ships was known as the **Middle Passage** because it served as the middle leg of the so-called triangular trade. On the first leg, European ships carried rum, clothing, household goods, and guns to Africa, which they exchanged for enslaved Africans. The captives then were taken on the second (or "middle") leg of the triangular trade to the Americas. Once the human cargo was unloaded, the ships were filled with timber, tobacco, rice, sugar, rum, and other products for the return voyage to English and European ports.

## Indentured Servants

> To solve the labour shortage, the planters first recruited **indentured servants** from England, Ireland, Scotland, and continental Europe. The term derived from the *indenture*, or contract, which enabled a person to pay for passage to America by promising to work for a fixed number of years (usually between three and seven).

## Iroquois League

> In the interior of New York, however, a different situation arose. There, sometime before 1600, the Iroquois Nations had forged an alliance so strong that the outnumbered Dutch and, later, English traders were forced to work with them to acquire beaver pelts. By the early seventeenth century, some fifty sachems (chiefs) governed the 12,000 members of the **Iroquois League**, known to its members as the *Haudenosaunee*.

## King Philip’s War

Back and forth between English Christians and Wampanoag Indians

> The gruesome violence spun out of control in what came to be called **King Philip's War (1675-1678)**, or Metacomet's (the Wampanoag chief) War. The fighting killed more people in proportion to the population than any American conflict since. Vengeful bands of warriors destroyed fifty colonial towns while killing and mutilating hundreds of men, women, and children. Rival Indians fought on both sides.

## Bacon’s Rebellion

> In the mid-1670s, simmering tensions caused by falling tobacco prices (stemming from overproduction), rising taxes, and crowds of landless freed servants sparked what came to be called **Bacon's Rebellion**. The discontent erupted when a squabble between a White planter and Indians on the Potomac River led to the murder of the planter's herdsman. Frontier vigilantes retaliated by killing some two dozen Indians. Enraged Indians took revenge by attacking frontier settlements.

## New Netherland

> The **New Netherland** colony emerged as a profit-making enterprise owned by a corporation, the Dutch West India Company. "Everyone here is a trader," explained one resident. Like the French, the Dutch were interested mainly in the fur trade, as the European demand for beaver hats created huge profits. In 1610, the Dutch established fur-trading posts on Manhattan Island and upriver at Fort Orange (later called Albany).

## North and South Carolina

> Carolina, the southernmost mainland British American colony in the seventeenth century, began as two widely separated areas which, in 1712, officially became **North and South Carolina**. The northernmost part, long called Albemarle, had been settled in the 1650s by colonists who had drifted southward from Virginia. For a half century, Albemarle remained a remote scattering of farms along the shores of Albemarle Sound.

## Parliament

> The people's representatives formed the national legislature known as **Parliament**, which comprised the hereditary and appointed members of the House of Lords and the elected members of the House of Commons. The crucial power allocated to Parliament was the authority to impose taxes on the people. By controlling tax revenue, the legislature exercised leverage over the monarchy, which needed tax revenues to sustain its power.

## Puritans

> King James I confronted a divided Church of England, with the reform-minded **Puritans** in one camp and the Anglican archbishop and bishops in the other. The Puritans were theologically conservative dissenters who believed that the Church of England needed further "purifying." All "papist" (Roman Catholic) rituals must go.

> The Puritans wanted to simplify religion to its most basic elements: people worshipping God in plain, self-governing congregations without the formal trappings of Catholic and Anglican ceremonies and centered on the sufficiency of the Bible.

## Tobacco

> Over the next several years, the Jamestown colony limped along until at last the settlers found a profitable crop: **tobacco**. Smoking had become a widespread habit in Europe, and tobacco plantations flourished on Caribbean islands.

> Despite its labour-intensive demands, the growing of tobacco became the most profitable enterprise in colonial Virginia and Maryland. Growing tobacco, however, quickly depleted soil of nutrients, so large-scale tobacco farming required increasingly more land for planting and more labourers to work the fields. Much like sugar and rice, tobacco would be one of the primary crops that would drive the demand for indentured servants and enslaved Africans.

## Headright

> In 1618, Sir Edwin Sandys, a prominent member of Parliament, became head of the Virginia Company. He launched a new **headright** (land grant) policy: anyone who bought a share in the company and could pay for passage to Virginia could have fifty acres upon arrival and fifty more for each servant he brought along.

## Powhatan Confederacy

> The **Powhatan Confederacy** dominated the indigenous peoples of the Chesapeake region. Chief Powhatan ruled several hundred villages (of about a hundred people each) organised into thirty chiefdoms in eastern Virginia. The Powhatans were farmers adept at growing corn. They lived in oval-shaped houses framed with bent saplings and covered with bark or mats.

## Mayflower Compact

> Since the *Mayflower* colonists were outside the jurisdiction of any organised government, forty-one of them, all men, resolved to rule themselves. They signed the **Mayflower Compact**, a covenant (group contract) to form a "civil body politic" based on "just and civil laws" designed "for the general good." The Mayflower Compact was not democracy in action, however. The saints granted only themselves the rights to vote and hold office. Their "inferiors" - the "strangers" and servants who also traveled on the *Mayflower* - would have to wait for their civil rights.

## Massachusetts Bay Colony

> The Plymouth colony's population never rose above 7,000, and after ten years it was overshadowed by its much larger neighbour, the **Massachusetts Bay Colony**. Like Plymouth, the new colony was also intended to be a holy commonwealth for Puritans, but the Massachusetts Bay Puritans were different from the Pilgrims. They remained Anglicans - they wanted to purify the Church of England from within.
