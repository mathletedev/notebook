## The Second Bank of the United States

> In 1816, Madison created the Second Bank of the United States, where the national government deposited its revenue. The second B.U.S. also exercised a regulating influence over the many state banks that were issuing their own paper currency.

> After President Madison and congressional Republicans allowed the charter for the First Bank of the United States to expire, in 1811, the nation’s finances fell into a muddle. States began chartering local banks with little or no regulation, and their banknotes (paper money) flooded the economy with different currencies of uncertain value. Imagine trying to do business on a national basis when each state-chartered bank had its own currency, which often was not accepted by other banks or in other states.

> In response, President Madison in 1816 urged Congress to establish a **Second Bank of the United States** (B.U.S.). The B.U.S. was intended primarily to support a stable national currency that would promote economic growth.

## Tariff of 1816

> In the end, Congress passed the Tariff of 1816, which placed a tax on imported cloth. Such tariffs were a major factor in spurring industrialization. By impeding foreign competition, they enabled American manufacturers to dominate the national marketplace.

> After the \[War of 1812] ended, however, British companies flooded U.S. markets with their less-expensive products. In response, northern manufacturers lobbied Congress for tariffs to protect their infant industries from “unfair” British competition.

> Congress responded by passing the **Tariff of 1816**, which placed a 20–25 percent tax on a long list of imported goods. Tariffs benefited some regions (the Northeast) more than others (the South), thus aggravating sectional tensions and grievances. Debates over federal tariffs would continue, in part because they provided much of the annual federal revenue and in part because they benefited manufacturers rather than consumers.

## Internal Improvements

> The third major element of economic nationalism in the first half of the nineteenth century involved federal financing of **internal improvements**, specifically the construction of roads, bridges, canals, and harbours. Most American rivers flowed from north to south, so the nation needed a network of roads running east to west.

## Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 1819

> The Supreme Court made two more decisions in 1819 that strengthened the power of the federal government at the expense of the states. One, ***Dartmouth College v. Woodward*** (1819), involved the New Hampshire legislature’s effort to change Dartmouth College’s charter to stop the college’s trustees from electing their own successors.

> This decision implied an enlarged definition of contract that seemed to put corporations beyond the reach of the states that had chartered them.

## McCulloch v. Maryland, 1819

> The second major Supreme Court case of 1819 was Chief Justice Marshall’s most significant interpretation of the constitutional system: ***McCulloch v. Maryland*** (1819). James McCulloch, a B.U.S. clerk in Baltimore, had refused to pay state taxes on B.U.S. currency, as required by a Maryland law. The state indicted McCulloch. Acting on behalf of the national bank, he appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously that Congress had the authority to charter the B.U.S. and that states had no right to tax the national bank.

## Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824

> John Marshall’s last great decision, ***Gibbons v. Ogden*** (1824), affirmed the federal government’s supremacy in regulating interstate commerce.

> In 1808, the New York legislature granted Robert Fulton and Robert R. Livingston the exclusive right to operate steamboats on the state’s rivers and lakes. Fulton and Livingston then gave Aaron Ogden, a former New Jersey governor, the exclusive right to ferry people and goods up the Hudson River between New York and New Jersey. Georgia planter Thomas Gibbons, however, operated ships under a federal license that competed with Ogden.

> On behalf of a unanimous Court, Marshall ruled in Gibbons v. Ogden (1824) that the monopoly granted by the state to Ogden conflicted with the federal license issued to Gibbons. Marshall added that Congress could regulate commerce not only between states but also activities within a state “connected with” interstate commerce. He said that Congress could exercise power “to its utmost extent” in such circumstances.

## American System

> The major economic initiatives debated by Congress after the War of 1812 - the national bank, federal tariffs, and federally financed roads, bridges, and canals - were interrelated pieces of a comprehensive economic plan called the **American System**. The term was coined by Henry Clay, the powerful Kentucky congressman. Clay wanted to free America’s economy from its dependence on Great Britain while tying together the diverse regions of the nation politically. “I know of no South, no North, no East, no West to which I owe my allegiance,” he asserted. “The Union is my country.”

## Panic of 1819

> The **Panic of 1819** resulted from the sudden collapse of cotton prices after British textile mills quit buying high-priced American cotton—the nation’s leading export—in favor of cheaper cotton from other parts of the world, especially the British colonies of Egypt and India.

Domino effect into national depression.

> The economic depression lasted about three years, and people blamed the B.U.S. After the panic subsided, many Americans, especially in the South and the West, remained critical of the national bank.

## Missouri Compromise of 1820

Balance between pro- and anti-slave states.

> Illinois senator Jesse Thomas revised the so-called **Missouri Compromise** by introducing an amendment to exclude slavery in the rest of the Louisiana Purchase territory north of latitude 36°30ʹ, Missouri’s southern border. Slavery thus would continue in the Arkansas Territory and in Missouri but would be excluded from the remainder of the area west of the Mississippi River. By a narrow margin, the Thomas Amendment passed on March 2, 1820.

> The debate over the Missouri Compromise revealed a widening sectional divide: the Northeast dominated by shipping, commerce, and manufacturing, the Midwest centered on small farms, and the South becoming more and more dependent on cotton and slavery.

## Transcontinental Treaty

> In 1819, Adams convinced the Spanish to sign the **Transcontinental Treaty** (also called the Adams-Onís Treaty), which gave all of Florida to the United States for $5 million. Florida thus became a U.S. territory; in 1845, it would become a state. The treaty also clarified the western boundary separating the Louisiana Territory from New Spain, explaining that it would run from the Gulf of Mexico north to the 42nd parallel and then west to the Pacific coast. The United States now spanned the continent.

## Monroe Doctrine

> The **Monroe Doctrine**, as it was named a generation later, contained four major points: (1) that “the American continents... are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers”; (2) that the United States would oppose any attempt by European nations to impose their political system anywhere in the hemisphere; (3) that the United States would not interfere with the remaining European-controlled colonies; and (4) that the United States would keep out of the internal affairs of European nations and their wars.

## Corrupt Bargain

> A deal between Clay and Adams broke the deadlock. Clay endorsed Adams, and the House of Representatives elected Adams with 13 state delegation votes to Jackson’s 7 and Crawford’s 4

> Jackson dismissed Clay as a “scoundrel,” the “Judas of the West,” who had entered into a self-serving “**corrupt bargain**” with Adams. Their “corruptions and intrigues,” he charged, had “defeated the will of the People.” American politics had now entered an Era of Bad Feelings

## Campaign of 1828

> The defiant congressional opposition to the Adams presidency launched the savage **campaign of 1828** between the National Republicans and the Jacksonian Democrats. Both sides engaged in vicious personal attacks. As a Jackson supporter observed, “The floodgates of falsehood, slander, and abuse have been hoisted” by the Adams campaign, “and the most nauseating filth is \[being] poured” on Jackson’s head.
