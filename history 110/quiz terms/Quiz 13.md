## Manifest Destiny

> The idea of a “**manifest destiny**” implied that the United States had a God-given mission to extend its Christian republic and capitalist economy from the Atlantic to the Pacific—and beyond. It flattered American vanity and offered a powerful, if self-serving, religious justification for expansion at the expense of Native Americans and Hispanics, Spaniards and the British.

## Overland Trails

> Most of the pioneers on the **Overland Trails** travelled in family groups. Oregon-bound wagon trains usually left Missouri in late spring and completed the gruelling 2,000-mile trek in six months. By 1845, some 5,000 people were making the journey annually.

## Oregon Fever

> Word of Oregon’s fertile soil, plentiful rainfall, mild climate, and magnificent forests spread eastward. By the late 1830s, farmers, missionaries, fur traders, and shopkeepers were travelling along the Oregon Trail, a 2,100-mile pathway that became the most strategic land route in North America.

## Texas Revolution

> In the fall of 1835, Texans rebelled against the “despotism” of the Mexican government. A furious Santa Anna ordered all Americans expelled from Texas, and all rebels arrested and executed. As sporadic fighting erupted, hundreds of armed volunteers from southern states rushed to assist the 30,000 Texans in the **Texas Revolution** against a Mexican nation of 7 million people. “The sword is drawn!” Stephen Austin proclaimed, promising 800 acres of land to anyone who joined the rebellion.

## Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo

> After the fall of Mexico City, Mexican leader Santa Anna resigned and fled the country. Peace talks began on January 2, 1848. News of the victory thrilled American expansionists. The editor John O’Sullivan, who had coined the phrase “manifest destiny,” shouted, “More, More, More! Why not take all of Mexico?”

> By the **Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo**, signed on February 2, a humiliated Mexico gave up half its entire territory: all of Texas north of the Rio Grande, the territories that would become the states of California, Arizona, New Mexico, and significant parts of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, and Nevada.

## Wilmot Proviso

> The Mexican-American War was less than three months old when it sparked a new political conflict over slavery. On August 8, 1846, an obscure Democratic congressman from Pennsylvania, David Wilmot, delivered a speech to the House of Representatives in which he proposed that if any Mexican territory should be acquired, slavery would be banned there.

> The proposed **Wilmot Proviso** reignited the debate over the westward expansion of slavery that had been lurking since the Missouri controversy of 1819–1821. The Missouri Compromise had provided a temporary solution by protecting slavery in states where it already existed but not allowing it in newly acquired territories north of the 36°30ʹ latitude. Now, with the territories taken from Mexico, the political dispute over slavery would explode.

## Popular Sovereignty

> Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan suggested a different solution: that the citizens of each territory “regulate their own internal concerns in their own way,” like the citizens of a state. Such an approach would take the issue of slavery in new territories out of Congress and put it in the hands of those directly affected. “Popular sovereignty,” as Cass called his idea, appealed to many eager to protect states’ rights.

## Free-Soil Party

> As a result, “Free Soil” in the western territories became the rallying cry for a new political party: the Free-Soil coalition, which focused on preventing the spread of slavery.

> The Free-Soil party attracted northern Democrats, anti-slavery northern Whigs, and members of the abolitionist Liberty party, created in 1840.

## California Gold Rush

> Meanwhile, a new development emerged in the Mexican province of Alta California. On January 24, 1848, on part of John Sutter’s land along the south fork of the American River, a group of Mormon and Indian workers building a sawmill in eastern California discovered gold. Just nine days later, California would be labelled the “great prize” transferred to the United States through the treaty ending the Mexican-American War.

> For all its hardships, however, the California Gold Rush became the greatest mass migration in American history. Between 1851 and 1855, the “diggings” throughout California produced almost half the world’s output of gold, and the nation’s supply of gold coinage increased twentyfold.

## Compromise of 1850

> On December 4, 1849, President Zachary Taylor endorsed the immediate admission of California for statehood and urged Congress to avoid injecting slavery into the issue. The new Congress, however, was in no mood for simple solutions. Angry southerners threatened to leave the Union if Taylor brought California and New Mexico in as free states. Doing so, they feared, would upset the political balance of fifteen slave states and fifteen free states.

> The spotlight then fell on the Senate, where an all-star cast—Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, and Daniel Webster (all of whom would die within two years), with William H. Seward, Stephen A. Douglas, and Jefferson Davis in supporting roles—staged one of the great dramas of American politics: the **Compromise of 1850**.

> In its final version, the Compromise of 1850 included the following elements:
> 1. California entered the Union as a free state, ending forever the balance of free and slave states.
> 2. The Texas–New Mexico Act made New Mexico a separate territory and set the Texas state boundary at its present location (in return for giving up its claims to much of New Mexico, Texas received $10 million to erase the state’s debt).
> 3. The Utah Act set up the Utah Territory and gave the territorial legislature authority over “all rightful subjects of legislation,” including slavery.
> 4. A Fugitive Slave Act required the federal government and northern states to help capture and return freedom seekers to the South.
> 5. As a gesture to anti-slavery groups, the public sale of enslaved people, but not slavery itself, was abolished in the District of Columbia.

## Fugitive Slave Act

> The **Fugitive Slave Act** was the most controversial element of the Compromise of 1850. It did more than strengthen the hand of slave catchers; it sought to recover freedom-seekers who had escaped. The law also unwittingly enabled slave traders to kidnap free Blacks in northern “free” states, claiming that they were freedom seekers, and it required citizens to help locate and capture freedom seekers. The act assigned federal officers to assist in slave-catching. Finally, the act denied freedom seekers the right to a jury trial and increased the penalty for interfering with slave catchers to $1,000 and six months in jail.

## Kansas-Nebraska Act

> In 1852 and 1853, Congress debated several proposals for a transcontinental rail line. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis of Mississippi favoured a southern route across the territories acquired from Mexico. Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois insisted that Chicago be the transcontinental railroad’s Midwest hub. To promote that idea, he urged Congress to pass the **Kansas-Nebraska Act** so that the vast territory west of Missouri and Iowa could be settled - by Whites.

## Bleeding Kansas

> The passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act soon placed Kansas at the centre of the increasingly violent debate over slavery. While Nebraska would become a free state, Kansas was up for grabs. According to the Kansas-Nebraska Act, the residents of the Kansas Territory, not Congress, would decide whether to allow slavery. The law, however, said nothing about when Kansans would decide about slavery, so each side tried to gain political control of the vast territory and worked to recruit emigrants to the Kansas territory.

> Soon the political conflict mushroomed into a civil war, which journalists called “**Bleeding Kansas**.”

Lots of violence, 200 settlers killed by 1856.

## Dred Scott v. Sandford

> In his inaugural address, President Buchanan asserted that the Supreme Court should decide the issue of slavery in the western territories. Two days later, on March 6, 1857, the Court delivered a momentous decision in the long-awaited case of ***Dred Scott v. Sandford***, which had taken eleven years to work its way through the state and federal courts. The New York Times declared it “the most important decision ever made by the Supreme Court.”

> Scott, born into slavery in Virginia, had been taken to Missouri in 1830, where slavery was legal. There he was sold to an army surgeon, who took him to Illinois, then to the Wisconsin Territory (later Minnesota), and finally back to St. Louis in 1842. While in the Wisconsin Territory, Scott had married Harriet Robinson, and they had two daughters.

> In 1846, Scott filed suit in Missouri, claiming that his residence in Illinois and the Wisconsin Territory had made him “free” because slavery was outlawed there. A Missouri jury decided in his favour, but the state supreme court ruled against him. When the case finally arose on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, the nation anxiously awaited its ruling.

Unfair bias of justices - 5 of the 9 were southern slaveholders. Final vote was 7-2 against Scott.

> The Dred Scott case thus directly challenged the concept of “popular sovereignty.” If Congress could not exclude slavery from a territory, as Taney argued, then neither could a territorial government created by an act of Congress. Suddenly, all the West - and the North - was open to slavery.

## Lincoln-Douglas Debates

> The **Lincoln-Douglas debates** took place from August 21 to October 15, 1858. They attracted thousands of spectators and transformed the statewide race into a battle for the future of the entire republic.

> The basic dispute between the two rivals, Lincoln insisted, lay in Douglas’s indifference to the immorality of slavery. Douglas, he said, did not care whether slavery in the territories was “voted up, or voted down.” Instead, he was preoccupied only with process (“popular sovereignty”); Lincoln claimed to be focused on principle.
