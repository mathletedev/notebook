## Republican Simplicity

> Jefferson's deliberate display of **republican simplicity** set the tone for his administration. He wanted Americans to notice the difference between the monarchical style of the Federalists and Republican simplicity

Thought Federalists wanted to destroy "the liberties of the people".

## Marbury v. Madison, 1803

- Jefferson (Republican) wanted a weak Supreme Court
- John Marshall (Federalist) wanted a powerful Supreme Court and criticised Jefferson

> The Marbury case involved the appointment of Maryland Federalist William Marbury as justice of peace in the District of Columbia. Marbury's letter of appointment (called a commission), signed by President John Adams two days before he left office, was still undelivered when James Madison took office as secretary of state, and President Jefferson directed Madison to withhold it. Marybury then sued for a court order directing Madison to deliver his commission.

> In the unanimous ruling, Marshall and the Court held that Marbury deserved his judgeship

> The *Marbury* decision granted the Supreme Court a power not mentioned in the Constitution: the right of *judicial review*, whereby the Court determines whether acts of Congress (and the presidency) are constitutional.

## Louisiana Purchase

Napoleon sold the entire territory from the Mississippi River west of the Rocky Mountains and from the Canadian border south to the Gulf of Mexico to the United States.

> Nowhere did the Constitution mention the purchase of territory. Was such an action legal?

> In the end, Jefferson's desire to double the size of the republic trumped his concerns about an unconstitutional exercise of executive power. Acquiring the Louisiana Territory, the president explained, would promote "the peace and security of the nation in general" by removing the French threat and creating a protective buffer separating the United States from the rest of the world.

> In a reversal of traditional stances, Federalists found themselves arguing for strict construction of the Constitution in opposing the Louisiana Purchase. "We are to give money of which we have too little for land of which we already have too much," argued a Bostonian in the *Columbian Centinel*.

> The **Louisiana Purchase** was the most significant event of Jefferson's presidency and one of the most important developments in American history. It spurred western exploration and expansion, and it enticed cotton growers to settle in the Old Southwest - Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

## Lewis and Clark Expedition

> To learn more about the Louisiana Territory and its prospects for trade and agriculture, Jefferson asked Congress to fund an expedition to find the most "practicable water communication across the continent." The president then appointed army captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark to lead what came to be known as the **Lewis and Clark expedition**.

Collected skins, specimens, and soil samples.
Delivered Sacagawea's baby, so she helped them as a guide, translator, and negotiator.

> Federalists panicked because they assumed that new states carved out of the Louisiana Territory would be dominated by Jeffersonian Republicans

Aaron Burr was Jefferson's Republican rival, who later ran as an independent candidate.
Hamilton told people not to vote for Burr, so Burr challenged Hamilton to a duel. Burr ended up killing Hamilton and fleeing.

## Barbary Pirates

Jefferson wanted peace with all nations.

> On the Barbary Coast of North Africa, the Islamic rulers of Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli had for centuries preyed upon unarmed European and American merchant ships. The U.S. government made numerous blackmail payments to the **Barbary pirates** in exchange for captured American merchant ships and crews.

## Embargo Act of 1807

Jefferson didn't want war with Britain and France, so he cut off all American foreign trade.
Neither Britain nor France were intimidated, but America's economy suffered greatly.

> Congress finally voted 70-0 to end the embargo effective March 4, 1809, the day the "splendid misery" of Jefferson's second presidential term ended. A dejected Jefferson left the presidency feeling like a freed prisoner. No one, he said, could be more relieved "on shaking off the shackles of power."

## War of 1812

> The **War of 1812** marked the first time that Congress declared war. Great Britain was preoccupied with defeating Napoleon in Europe, and in fact, on June 16, 1812, it had promised to quit interfering with American shipping. President Madison and the Republicans, however, believed that only war would end the practice of impressment and stop British-inspired Indian attacks along the western frontier.

Impressment: The act of seizing for public use or of impressing into public service.

## Battle of Tippecanoe

Tecumseh tried to unite many Native American nations to stop the advancement of Americans.
- 5,000 Indians vs. 1,000 Americans

> What became the **Battle of Tippecanoe** was a disastrous defeat for the Native Americans, as Harrison's troops burned the village and destroyed its supplies. **Tecumseh's Indian Confederacy** went up in smoke, and he fled to Canada.

## Treaty of Ghent

> In the **Treaty of Ghent (1814)**, the two countries agreed to return each side's prisoners and restore the previous boundaries. This was a godsend for the Americans, since British forces at the time still controlled eastern Maine, northern Michigan, a portion of western New York, and several islands off the coast of Georgia. The British also pledged to stop supporting Indian attacks along the Great Lakes.

> More important, the Treaty of Ghent saved the splintered republic from possible civil war and financial ruin.

## Battle of New Orleans

> Because it took six weeks for news of the Treaty of Ghent to reach the United States, fighting continued at the end of 1814. On December 1, Andrew Jackson arrived in New Orleans to prepare for a British invasion. When Jackson learned of the British plan to seize New Orleans, he responded, "I will smash them, so help me God!" Jackson declared martial law and transformed New Orleans into an armed camp as he prepared its defense.

Americans convincingly defeated the British.

> Although the **Battle of New Orleans** occurred after the Treaty of Ghent had been signed, it was vitally important psychologically. Had the British won, they might have tried to revise the treaty in their favour. Jackson's victory ensured that both governments would act quickly to approve the treaty.

## Hartford Convention

> On December 15, 1814, a few weeks before the Battle of New Orleans, New England Federalists, frustrated by the rising expense of "Mr. Madison's War," convened the **Hartford Convention** in Hartford, Connecticut.

Federalists wanted to reduce Republicans' power by proposing seven constitutional amendments.
However, failed because of the Victory at New Orleans.

> Ignored by Congress and the president, the Federalist delegates turned tail for home. The sorry episode proved fatal to the Federalist party, which never recovered from the shame of disloyalty stamped on it by the Hartford Convention. The victory at New Orleans and the arrival of the peace treaty from Europe transformed the national mood. Almost overnight, President Madison went from being denounced and possibly impeached to being hailed a national hero.

Marked the end of the Federalist party.
