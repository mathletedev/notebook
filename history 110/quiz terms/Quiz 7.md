## Republican Simplicity

> Jefferson's deliberate display of **republican simplicity** set the tone for his administration. He wanted Americans to notice the difference between the monarchical style of the Federalists and Republican simplicity

Thought Federalists wanted to destroy "the liberties of the people".

## Marbury v. Madison, 1803

- Jefferson (Republican) wanted a weak Supreme Court
- John Marshall (Federalist) wanted a powerful Supreme Court and criticised Jefferson

> The Marbury case involved the appointment of Maryland Federalist William Marbury as justice of peace in the District of Columbia. Marbury's letter of appointment (called a commission), signed by President John Adams two days before he left office, was still undelivered when James Madison took office as secretary of state, and President Jefferson directed Madison to withhold it. Marybury then sued for a court order directing Madison to deliver his commission.

> In the unanimous ruling, Marshall and the Court held that Marbury deserved his judgeship

> The *Marbury* decision granted the Supreme Court a power not mentioned in the Constitution: the right of *judicial review*, whereby the Court determines whether acts of Congress (and the presidency) are constitutional.

## Louisiana Purchase

Napoleon sold the entire territory from the Mississippi River west of the Rocky Mountains and from the Canadian border south to the Gulf of Mexico to the United States.

> Nowhere did the Constitution mention the purchase of territory. Was such an action legal?

> In the end, Jefferson's desire to double the size of the republic trumped his concerns about an unconstitutional exercise of executive power. Acquiring the Louisiana Territory, the president explained, would promote "the peace and security of the nation in general" by removing the French threat and creating a protective buffer separating the United States from the rest of the world.

> In a reversal of traditional stances, Federalists found themselves arguing for strict construction of the Constitution in opposing the Louisiana Purchase. "We are to give money of which we have too little for land of which we already have too much," argued a Bostonian in the *Columbian Centinel*.

> The **Louisiana Purchase** was the most significant event of Jefferson's presidency and one of the most important developments in American history. It spurred western exploration and expansion, and it enticed cotton growers to settle in the Old Southwest - Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.
