## Death Rate

> Life in colonial America was hard. Many of the first colonists died of disease or starvation; others were killed by Native Americans. The average **death rate** was 50 percent. Once colonial life became more settled, however, the population grew rapidly. On average, it doubled very twenty-five years.

## Birth Rate

> The **birth rate** rose accordingly, since women who married earlier had time for about two additional pregnancies during their child-bearing years. On average, a married woman had a child every two to three years before menopause.

## Women's Work

> During the eighteenth century, **women's work** typically centered on activities in the house, garden, and fields. Yet the scarcity of workers in the colonies created new opportunities for women outside the home or farm. In towns, women commonly served as tavern hostesses and shopkeeper and occasionally also worked as doctors, printers, upholsters, painters, and silversmiths.

## Staple Crops

> Warm weather and plentiful rainfall helped the southern colonies grow the profitable **staple crops** (also called cash crops) valued by the mother country. Tobacco production soared.

## Massachusetts Royal Charter

> Another blow to Puritan ideals came with the Massachusetts royal charter of 1691, which required the Puritan colony to "tolerate" religious dissenters (such as Quakers) and based the right to vote on property ownership rather than church membership.

## Triangular Trade

> These circumstances gave rise to the **triangular trade**. New England merchants shipped rum to the west coast of Africa, where it was exchanged for enslaved people. Ships then took the captive Africans to profitable Caribbean islands to sell. The ships returned home with various commodities, including molasses, from which New Englanders manufactured rum. In another version, shippers sent foodstuffs to the Caribbean, carried sugar and molasses to England, and returned with goods manufactured in Europe.

## Race-Based Slavery

> Most Europeans during the colonial period viewed **race-based slavery** as a normal aspect of everyday life in an imperfect world; few considered it a moral issue. They instead believed that God determined one's "station in life." Slavery was thus considered a "personal misfortune" dictated by God rather than a social evil.

## Slave Codes

> During the 1660s, colonial legislatures formalised the institution of race-based slavery, with detailed **slave codes** regulating most aspects of enslaved people's lives.

## Stono Rebellion

> The **Stono Rebellion**, the largest uprising of the colonial period, so frightened White planters that they convinced the South Carolina assembly to ban the importation of enslaved Africans for ten years and pass the Negro Act of 1740, which called for more oversight of enslaved people's activities and harsher punishments for rebellious behaviour.

> On Sunday morning, September 9, 1739, while White families were attending church, some twenty African-born enslaved people attacked a store in Stono, South Carolina, twenty miles southwest of Charles Town. Led by an enslaved person named Jemmy, the rebels seized weapons, killed and decapitated two shopkeepers, and fled south toward Spanish Florida. Along the way, they gathered more recruits. Within a few days, the enslaved people had burned six plantations and killed about two dozen Whites.

## Enlightenment

> The most significant of the new European ideas circulating in eighteenth-century America grew out of a burst of intellectual activity known as the **Enlightenment**. The Enlightenment celebrated rational inquiry, scientific research, and individual freedom.

## Deists

> Some enlightened people, called **Deists**, carried Newton's scientific outlook to its logical conclusion, claiming that God created the world and designed its natural laws, which governed the operation of the universe. In other words, God planned the universe and set it in motion, but no longer interacted directly with the earth and its people.

## Great Awakening

> During the early 1730s, worries about the erosion of religious fervour helped spark a series of revivals known as the **Great Awakening**. The revivals spread up and down the Atlantic coast. The highly emotional gatherings divided congregations, towns, and families, and fueled popular new denominations, especially the Baptists and Methodists.

## Sarah Haggar Osborne

> The Great Awakening's most controversial element was the emergence of women who defied convention by speaking at religious services. Among them was **Sarah Haggar Osborne**, a Rhode Island schoolteacher who organised prayer meetings that eventually included men and women, Black and White. When concerned ministers told her to stop, she refused to "shut my mouth and doors and creep into obscurity."
