## Grimké Sisters

> A showdown between the rival anti-slavery camps erupted in 1840 over the issue of women’s rights, with the scandalous activities of the Grimké sisters serving as the catalyst. Sarah and Angelina Grimké, born to a wealthy South Carolina family, grew up being served by enslaved people. In 1821, shortly after her father’s death, Sarah moved from Charleston to Philadelphia, joined the Society of Friends (Quakers), and renounced slavery. Angelina soon followed her, and in 1835, the sisters joined the abolitionist movement. After they appealed to southern Christian women to end slavery, the mayor of Charleston told their mother that they would be jailed if they returned home.

> The Grimké sisters travelled widely, speaking first to audiences of women and eventually to groups of both sexes. Their unconventional (promiscuous) behaviour in speaking to mixed-gender audiences prompted sharp criticism from ministers in the anti-slavery movement. Catharine Beecher reminded the sisters that women occupied “a subordinate relation in society to the other sex” and that they should limit their activities to the “domestic and social circle.

## William Lloyd Garrison

> But it was slavery that most excited his indignation. In 1831, free Blacks helped convince Garrison to launch an anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator, which became the voice of the nation’s first civil rights movement. Of the first 500 subscribers, 450 were free Blacks, leading Garrison to explain that The Liberator did not belong to Whites but to people of colour: “It is their organ.”

## Elizabeth Cady Stanton

> But Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the leaders of the movement to secure voting rights for women, insisted that the amendment should have included women. As Anthony stressed, the U.S. Constitution refers to “We, the people; not we, the white male citizens; nor yet we, the male citizens; but we, the whole people, who formed the Union—women as well as men.”

> Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton had founded the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA) in 1869 to promote a women’s suffrage amendment to the Constitution. They condemned both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments for limiting voting rights to males only. The NWSA agitated for more than the right to vote. Its members also campaigned for higher pay for working women and for laws helping abused wives secure divorces.

## Underground Railroad

> Between 1810 and 1850, tens of thousands of enslaved people in the South fled north. Freedom seekers would make their way, usually at night, from one “station,” or safe house, to the next. The organisations and the systems of safe houses and shelters in the border states such as Maryland and Kentucky (and farther north) were referred to as the **Underground Railroad**. The “conductors” helping the freedom seekers included freeborn Blacks, White abolitionists, formerly enslaved people, and Native Americans. Unitarians, Quakers, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists also participated.

## Abolitionism

> This harsh reality led to a change in tactics among anti-slavery organisations, many of which were energised by evangelical religions and the emerging social activism of transcendentalism. Their initial efforts to promote a gradual end to slavery by prohibiting it in the western territories and using moral persuasion to convince owners to free their enslaved people steadily gave way to demands for immediate **abolitionism** everywhere.

## American Colonization Society

> The first organised emancipation movement appeared in 1816 with the formation of the **American Colonization Society** (ACS) in Washington, D.C., whose mission was to raise funds to transport free Blacks back to Africa. Its supporters included James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Henry Clay, John Marshall, and Daniel Webster.

> Some supported the colonisation movement because they opposed slavery; others saw it as a way to get rid of free Blacks. “We must save the Negro,” one missionary explained, “or the Negro will ruin us.” White supremacy remained a powerful assumption, even among abolitionists.

## Utopian Communities

> Amid the climate of reform, the quest for everyday utopias - ideal communities with innovative social and economic relationships - flourished. Plans for creating heaven on earth had long been an American passion, at least since the Puritans set out to build a holy colony in New England.

> In the nineteenth century, more than 100 **utopian communities** were established. Religious motives animated many of them, while others reflected faith in the Enlightenment ideal that every social problem had a solution discoverable by scientific study. Some utopias were communitarian experiments emphasizing the welfare of the entire community rather than individual freedom and private profits. Others experimented with “free love,” socialism, and special diets. What they shared was a conviction that mainstream society was fundamentally flawed and irredeemable.

## Declaration of Rights and Sentiments

> The activists at Seneca Falls did not go that far, but they did issue a clever paraphrase of the Declaration of Independence. The **Declaration of Rights and Sentiments** proclaimed that “all men and women are created equal.” All laws that placed women “in a position inferior to that of men, are contrary to the great precept of nature, and therefore of no force or authority.” The convention’s most controversial demand was the right to vote.

## Cult of Domesticity

> In 1842, Catharine Beecher published A Treatise on Domestic Economy, which promoted the **cult of domesticity**, a powerful ideology that called upon women to accept and celebrate their role as manager of the household and nurturer of the children, separate from the man’s sphere of work outside the home. Beecher argued that young women should be trained not for careers outside the home but for a life centred in the household. As a result, the prospects for women remained relatively unchanged. They were barred from the ministry and most other professions. They could not vote or serve on juries. College was rarely an option. A wife often had no control over her property or her children. She could not make a will, sign a contract, or bring suit in court without her husband’s permission.

## Temperance

> The **temperance** crusade was among the most widespread of the reform movements. Many people argued that the worst social problems were rooted in alcohol abuse. William Cobbett, an English reformer who travelled in the United States, noted in 1819 that virtually every time he visited an American home his hosts asked him “to drink wine or spirits, even in the morning."

> In 1826, a group of ministers in Boston organised the American Society for the Promotion of Temperance, which sponsored lectures, press campaigns, and the formation of local and state societies. A favourite tactic was to ask everyone who pledged to quit drinking to put by their signature a letter T for “total abstinence.” With that, a new word entered the English language: *teetotaler*.

## Transcendentalism

> The most intense American advocates of Romantic ideals were the transcendentalists of New England. Transcendentalism promoted a radical individualism and personal spirituality separate from organised religion. The word **transcendentalism** came from an emphasis on thoughts and behaviours that transcend (or rise above) the limits of reason and logic. To transcendentalists, the inner life of the spirit took priority over the hard facts of science and the rigidities of organised religion. Transcendentalism, said one of its champions, meant an interest in areas “a little beyond” the scope of reason.

## Mormon Church

> The Second Great Awakening also spawned new religious groups. The burned-over district in New York gave rise to several movements, the most important of which was Mormonism. Its founder, Joseph Smith Jr., the child of an intensely religious Vermont farm couple who settled in the western New York village of Palmyra, was born and raised amid the excitement of revivalism.

> With this book as his gospel, young Smith became Jesus’s prophet, and he began telling the story of his “marvilous [sic] experience” and gathering thousands of converts (saints) who shared his desire to live together in accordance with the teachings of Jesus. Eventually, Smith formed what he called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, often informally known as the **Mormon Church**. In keeping with the teachings of Jesus and the democratic spirit of the times, Smith maintained that God, angels, and people were all members of the same flesh-and-blood species. God “is a man like one of you,” Smith told his followers.

## Second Great Awakening

> Around 1800, the United States experienced a massive wave of religious revivals called the **Second Great Awakening**. While all denominations grew as a result of the Second Great Awakening, the evangelical sects - Baptists, Methodists, and Presbyterians - experienced explosive popularity. In 1780, the nation had only 50 Methodist churches; by 1860, there were 20,000, far more than any other denomination. The percentage of Americans who joined Protestant churches increased sixfold between 1800 and 1860.

## Universalists

> A parallel anti-Calvinist movement, Universalism, attracted a different - and much larger - social group: the working poor. In 1779, John Murray, a British clergyman, founded the first Universalist church, in Gloucester, Massachusetts. Like the Unitarians, **Universalists** proclaimed the dignity and worth of all people. They stressed that believers must liberate themselves from the rule of priests and ministers and use their own God-given reasoning to explore the mysteries of existence.

> To Universalists and Unitarians, hell was a myth; it did not exist. Salvation was “universal,” available to everyone through the sacrifice of Jesus. In essence, Universalists thought God was too caring to damn people to hell, while Unitarians thought themselves too good to be damned. (The two denominations would combine in 1961, becoming the Unitarian Universalist faith.)

## Unitarians

> **Unitarians** abandoned the concept of the Trinity (God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost) that had long been central to the Christian faith, believing instead that God and Jesus were separate. Jesus was a saintly man (but not divine) who set a shining example. Unitarians also stressed that people were not inherently sinful. By following the teachings of Jesus and trusting their own consciences, all people were eligible for salvation.
