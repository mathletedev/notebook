## Quartering Act

> Then, in 1765, Grenville persuaded Parliament to pass the Quartering Act as part of his new system of colonial regulations. The Quartering Act required the colonies to feed and house many of the 10,000 British troops stationed in the colonies. Such a step seemed perfectly appropriate to Grenville, since he and many others in Britain believed that the Americans should contribute to the expense of defending the colonies. Many colonists, however, viewed the Quartering Act as yet another form of tax as well as another form of repression.

## Declaration of Independence

> The more memorable date, however, became July 4, 1776, when fifty-six members of Congress formally adopted the **Declaration of Independence** creating the "United States of America." The stakes could not have been higher. The delegates knew that they were likely to be hanged if captured by British troops.

## Committee of Correspondence

Gaspee Incident: British warship chasing smugglers ran aground, crew stole livestock, angry Americans shot captain and burned ship

> In response to the *Gaspee* incident, Sam Adams organised the **Committee of Correspondence**, which issued a statement of American rights and grievances and invited other towns to do the same. Similar committees sprang up across the colonies, forming a unified network of resistance.

## Stamp Act

> In February 1765, George Grenville pushed through an even more controversial measure. The **Stamp Act** required colonists to purchase paper from London embossed with a government revenue stamp. Only British currency could be used to purchase the stamped paper. It affected all colonists because it applied to paper for virtually every possible use: news-papers, pamphlets, bonds, leases, deeds, licences, insurance policies, college diplomas, even playing cards. The requirement would go into effect November 1.

## Albany Plan of Union

> At the urging of Pennsylvania's Benjamin Franklin, the Albany Congress (June 19 - July 11, 1754) approved the **Albany Plan of Union**. It called for eleven colonies to band together, headed by a president appointed by the king. Each colonial assembly would send two to seven delegates to a "grand council," which would have legislative powers. The Union would have jurisdiction over Indian affairs.

## Common Sense

> In January 1776, Paine published a stirring fifty-page pamphlet titled ***Common Sense***, in which he urged Americans to seize their independence. Nothing was more absurd, he maintained, than the notion that God had given kings the right to rule with absolute power or that an island nation (England) should exercise dominance over an entire continent (North America).

## Boston Tea Party

> On December 16, 1773, scores of Patriots dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded three British cargo ships in Boston Harbour and dumped 342 chests filled with forty-six tons of East India Company tea into the icy water. The **Boston Tea Party** was, according to John Adams, "so bold, so daring" that it represented a turning point in relations with the monarchy.

## Boston Massacre

> On the evening of March 5, 1770, two dozen "saucy" Boston rowdies - teens, Irishmen, and sailors - began throwing icicles and oyster shells at Hugh White, a young soldier guarding the Customs House. Someone rang the town fire bell, drawing a larger crowd to the scene, as the taunting continued: "Kill him, kill him, knock him down. Fire, d\*\*\* you, fire, you dare not fire!"
> A squad of soldiers arrived to help White, but the surly crowd surrounded them. When someone knocked a soldier down, he arose and fired his musket. Others joined in. After the smoke had cleared, five men lay dead or dying on the cobblestone street, and eight more were wounded. The first one killed was Crispus Attucks, a formerly enslaved man who worked at the docks. The *Boston Gazette* called it a "horrid massacre." More than 10,000 people attended the funerals of the murdered colonists.

## Loyalists

> In October 1768, in response to an appeal by the royal governor, 4,000 British troops arrived in Boston, the hotbed of colonial resistance. They disembarked with great ceremony, marching through the streets behind a brass band. **Loyalists**, as the Americans who supported the king and Parliament had begun to be called, welcomed the soldiers; **Patriots**, those rebelling against British authority, viewed the troops as an occupation force.

## Daughters of Liberty

> Calling themselves **Daughters of Liberty**, Whig women stopped buying imported British clothes and quit drinking British tea to "save this abused Country from Ruin and Slavery."

## Proclamation of 1763

> To help keep peace with the Indians and to abide by the terms of an earlier agreement with the Delawares and Shawnees, King George III issued the **Proclamation Act of 1763**, which drew an imaginary line along the crest of the Appalachian Mountains from Canada to Georgia. Americans ("our loving subjects") were forbidden to go west of the line to ensure that the Indians would not be "molested or disturbed" on their ancestral lands. Settlers already living west of the Appalachians were told to leave.

## Treaty of Paris

> The **Treaty of Paris**, signed in February 1763, gave Britain control of France's territories east of the Mississippi River. This encompassed all of Canada, what was then Spanish Florida (including much of present-day Alabama and Mississippi), and several sugar-growing islands in the West Indies. As compensation, Spain received the vast Louisiana Territory, including the strategic port of New Orleans and all French land west of the Mississippi. France was left with no territory on the North American continent, while Great Britain emerged as the greatest empire in the world.

## Glorious Revolution

> People called the revolution "glorious" because it took place with little bloodshed. Catholic king James II, fearing imprisonment, fled to France and was replaced by his daughter Mary and her husband William III, the ruling Dutch Prince (and the king's nephew). Both William and Mary were Protestants.

## Navigation Acts

> Such mercantilist assumptions prompted Oliver Cromwell to adopt the first in a series of **Navigation Acts** intended to increase control over the colonial economies. The Navigation Act of 1651 required that all goods going to and from the colonies be transported *only* in English-owned ships. The law was intended to hurt the Dutch, who had developed a thriving shipping business between America and Europe. Dutch shipowners charged much less to transport goods than did the English, and they encouraged smuggling in the colonies as a means of defying the Navigation Acts. By 1651, England and the Netherlands were at war - the first of three naval conflicts between 1652 and 1674 involving the two Protestant rivals.

## Mercantilism

> As England's new ruler, Cromwell sought to enforce **mercantilism**, a political and economic policy in which the government controlled economic activities. Key industries were regulated, taxed, or "subsidised" (supported by payments from the government), and people with specialised skills or knowledge of new technologies, such as textile machinery, were not allowed to leave the country.
