## Guns, Germs, and Steel

## Maize

> Indigenous peoples became expert at growing plants that would become the primary food crops of the hemisphere, chiefly **maize (corn)**, beans, and squash, but also chili peppers, avocados, and pumpkins.

> Maize-based societies viewed corn as the "gift of the gods" because it provided many essential needs. They made hominy by soaking dried kernels of corn in a mixture of water and ashes and then cooking it. They used corn cobs for fuel and the husks to fashion mats, masks, and dolls. They also ground the kernels into cornmeal, which could be mixed with beans to make protein-rich succotash.

## Mexicas

> During the thirteenth century, the nomadic **Mexicas** (Me-SHEE-kas) began drifting southward from northwest Mexico. (They were not called Aztecs until 1821, when Mexico gained its independence from Spain.) Disciplined and imaginative, the Mexicas seized control of the central highlands, where they built the spectacular city of Tenochtitlan (place of the stone cactus) on an island in Lake Tetzcoco, at the site of present-day Mexico City.

## Mexica Empire

> Tenochtitlan would become one of the grandest cities in the world. It served as the capital of a sophisticated **Mexica Empire** ruled by a powerful emperor and divided into two social classes: nobles, warriors, and priests (about 5 percent of the population), and the free commoners - merchants, artisans, farmers, and enslaved peoples.

> When the Spanish invaded Mexico in 1519, they found a vast Mexica Empire connected by a network of roads serving 371 city-states organised into 38 provinces. Towering stone temples, paved avenues, thriving marketplaces, and some 70,000 *adobe* (sunbaked mud) huts dominated Tenochtitlan
