Some notation:
$\forall$: "for all"
$\in$: "in" or "an element of"

E.g. $\forall \vec x \in \mathbb R^3$

> *Definition: Standard Basis Vectors / Elementary Vectors*
> A set of vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ where each vector satisfies the property that exactly one of their components is one and all other components are zero.

In $\mathbb R^3$, the elementary vectors are:
$$ e_1 = e_x = i = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad e_2 = e_y = j = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \quad e_3 = e_z = k = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} $$

> *Definition: The Identity Matrix*
> The identity matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements of the principal diagonal are ones and all other elements are zeros.

In $\mathbb R^3$, the identity matrix is:
$$ I = I_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} $$

> *Observation*
> All vectors can be written as a linear combination of elementary vectors.

> *Example*
> Decompose the vector $\begin{bmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ as a linear combination of elementary vectors.

$= 3e_1 -2e_2 + e_3$

> *Example*
> Suppose $T$ is a linear transformation from $\mathbb R^2$ to $\mathbb R^3$ such that
> $$ T(e_1) = \begin{bmatrix} 5 \\ -7 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad T(e_2) = \begin{bmatrix} -3 \\ 8 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}. $$
> Determine $T(x)$ and identify a matrix $A$ such that $T(x) = Ax$.

$T(x) = \begin{bmatrix} 5x_1 -3x_2 \\ -7x_1 + 2x_2 \\ 2x_1 \end{bmatrix}$

$A = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & -3 \\ -7 & 2 \\ 2 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

Notice that $A = \begin{bmatrix} T(e_1) & T(e_2) \end{bmatrix}$.

> *Theorem*
> Let $T : \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$ be a linear transformation. Then there exists a unique matrix $A$ such that $T(x) = A(x)$ for all $x$ in $\mathbb R^n$.
> In fact, $A$ is the $m \times n$ matrix whose $j$th column is the vector $T(e_j)$, where $e_j$ is the $j$th column of the identity matrix in $\mathbb R^n$.
> $$ A = \begin{bmatrix} T(e_1) & \dots & T(e_n) \end{bmatrix} $$

## Functions and Mappings

> *Definition: Function*
> A **function** is a relation in which every input has exactly one output.

> *Definition: One-to-One Mapping*
> A mapping $T : \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$ is **one-to-one** (also called **injective**)  if each $\vec b$ in $\mathbb R^m$ is the image of at most one $\vec x$ in $\mathbb R^n$.

> *Definition: Onto Mapping*
> A mapping $T : \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$ is **onto** (also called **surjective**) if each $\vec b$ in $\mathbb R^m$ is the image of at least one $\vec x$ in $\mathbb R^n$.

> *Definition: Bijection*
> A function that is both injective and surjective (one-to-one and onto) is called a **bijection**.

> *Question*
> Let $T$ be the linear transformation whose standard matrix is
> $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -4 & 8 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 & -1 & 3 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 5 \end{bmatrix} $$
> Does $T$ map $\mathbb R^4$ onto $\mathbb R^3$? is $T$ a one-to-one mapping?

Since $x_3$ is a free variable, $T$ is *not* a one-to-one mapping.

## Pivots

In columns:
- Determine basic and free variables
- If there is a pivot in every column, the columns are linearly independent
- If there is not a pivot in every column, the columns are linearly dependent

In rows:
- If there is a pivot in every row of a $m \times n$ matrix, it spans $\mathbb R^m$

> *Theorem*
> Let $T : \mathbb R^n \rightarrow \mathbb R^m$ be a [[1.8 Introduction to Linear Transformations|linear transformation]]. Then $T$ is one-to-one if and only if the equation $T(x) = 0$ has only the trivial solution.

To prove an **iff** statement, you must prove two statements:
- If $P$, then $Q$.
- If $Q$, then $P$.

Instead of showing
- If $Q$, then $P$,

we can use the logically equivalent statement
- If $\neg P$, then $\neg Q$

This statement is called the **contrapositive**.
