> *Definition: Echelon Form*
> A rectangular matrix is in **echelon form** (or **row echelon form**) if it has the following three properties:
> 1. All nonzero rows are above any row of zeros.
> 2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
> - Note: The leading entry is the first nonzero entry in the row.
> 3. All entries in a column below a leading entry are a zero.
> - Note: This property is redundant as it is forced by property two.
> 
> If a matrix is in echelon form satisfies the following additional conditions, then it is in **reduced echelon form** (or **reduced row echelon form**).
> 4. The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1.
> 5. Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column.

> *Theorem: Uniqueness of Reduced Echelon Form*
> Each matrix is row equivalent to one and only one reduced echelon matrix.

> *Definition: Pivot Position and Pivot Column*
> A **pivot position** in a matrix $A$ is the location in $A$ that corresponds to a leading 1 in the reduced echelon form of $A$. A **pivot column** is a column of $A$ that contains a pivot position.
