Identity matrix:
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

> *Temporary Definition: Invertible*
> A $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is **invertible** if there exists $n \times n$ matrices $C$ and $D$ such that $CA = I_n$ and $AD = I_m$.

> *Definition: Invertible*
> A square matrix $A$ is **invertible** if there exists a matrix $B$ such that $AB = I$ and $BA = I$. The inverse of $A$ is typically denoted $A^{-1}$.

Note: Some books refer to non-invertible matrices as **singular** and invertible matrices as non-singular.

> *Definition: Elementary Matrices*
> An **elementary matrix** is a matrix that describes an [[1.1 Systems of Linear Equations#Elementary Row Operations|elementary row operation]] on an identity matrix.

Examples:

R2 + 2R1 -> R2: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

R2 <-> R3: $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}$

3R1 -> R1: $\begin{bmatrix} 3 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

To find $A^{-1}$, adjoin $I_n$ to $A$, then use row operations to transform $A$ into $I_n$.

> *Theorem*
> 1. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then $A^{-1}$ is invertible and
> $$ (A^{-1})^{-1} = A. $$
> 2. If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ invertible matrices, then so is $AB$, and the inverse of $AB$ is the product of the inverses of $A$ and $B$ in reverse order. That is,
> $$ (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1}. $$
> 3. If $A$ is an invertible matrix, then so is $A^T$, and the inverse of $A^T$ is the transpose of $A^{-1}$. That is,
> $$ (A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T $$
> 4. A $n \times m$ matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $A$ is row equivalent to $I_n$.
