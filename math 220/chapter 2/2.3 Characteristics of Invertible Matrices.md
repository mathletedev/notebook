> *Theorem: The Invertible Matrix Theorem*
> Let $A$ be a square $n \times n$ matrix. Then the following statements are equivalent.
> That is, for a given $A$, the statements are either all true or all false.
> 1. $A$ is an invertible matrix.
> 2. $A$ is row equivalent to the $n \times n$ identity matrix.
> 3. $A$ has $n$ pivot positions.
> 4. The equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$ has only the trivial solution.
> 5. The columns of $A$ form a linearly independent set.
> 6. The linear transformation $\vec x \rightarrow A \vec x$ is [[1.9 The Matrix of a Linear Transformation#Functions and Mappings|one-to-one]].
> 7. The equation $A \vec x = \vec b$ has at least one solution for each $\vec b$ in $\mathbb R^n$.
> 8. The columns of $A$ span $\mathbb R^n$.
> 9. The linear transformations $\vec x \rightarrow A \vec x$ maps $\mathbb R^n$ onto $\mathbb R^n$.
> 10. There is an $n \times n$ matrix $C$ such that $CA = I_n$.
> 11. There is an $n \times n$ matrix $D$ such that $AD = I_n$.
> 12. $A^T$ is an invertible matrix.
