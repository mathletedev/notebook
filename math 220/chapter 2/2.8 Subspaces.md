> *Definition: Subspace (of $\mathbb R^n$)*
> A **subspace** of $\mathbb R^n$ is any set $H$ in $\mathbb R^n$ that has three properties:
> 1. The zero vector is in $H$.
> 2. For each $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $H$, the sum $\vec u + \vec v$ is in $H$.
> 3. For each $\vec u$ in $H$ and each scalar $c$, the vector $c \vec u$ is in $H$.
> That is to say, the subspace is *closed* under addition and scalar multiplication.

> *Definition: Column Space*
> The **column space** of matrix $A$ is the set $\text{Col}A$ of all linear combinations of the columns of $A$.

> *Definition: Null Space*
> The **null space** of a matrix $A$ is the set $\text{Nul}A$ of all solutions of the homogeneous equation $A \vec x = \vec 0$.

> *Theorem*
> The null space of a $m \times n$ matrix $A$ is a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$. Equivalently, the set of all solutions of a system $A \vec x = \vec 0$ of $m$ homogeneous linear equations in $n$ unknowns is a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.

- The null space is the **domain** of a transformation
- The column space is the **codomain** of a transformation

> *Definition: Basis for a Subspace*
> A **basis** for a subspace $H$ of $\mathbb R^n$ is a linearly independent set in $H$ that spans $H$.
