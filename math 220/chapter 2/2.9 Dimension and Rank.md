> *Definition: Coordinates (Relative to a Basis)*
> Suppose the set $B = \{ \vec b_1, \vec b_2, \dots, \vec b_p \}$ is a basis for a [[2.8 Subspaces|subspace]] $H$. For each $\vec x$ in $H$, the coordinates of $\vec x$ relative to the basis $B$ are the weights $c_1, \dots, c_p$ such that $\vec x = c_1 \vec b_1 + \cdots + c_p \vec b_p$. The vector in $\mathbb R^p$
> $$ \begin{bmatrix} \vec x \end{bmatrix}_B = \begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_p \end{bmatrix} $$
> is called the **coordinate vector** of $\vec x$ (relative to $B$) or the $B$-coordinate vector of $\vec x$.

> *Definition: Dimension of a Subspace*
> The **dimension** of a nonzero subspace $H$, denoted by $\text{dim}H$, is the number of vectors in any basis for $H$. The dimension of the zero subspace $\{ \vec 0 \}$ is defined to be zero.

> *Definition: Rank*
> The **rank** of a matrix $A$, denoted by $\text{rank}A$, is the dimension of the column space of $A$.

> *Theorem: The Rank Theorem*
> If a matrix $A$ has $n$ columns, then $\text{rank}A + \text{dim} \text{Nul}A = n$.

> *Theorem: The Basis Theorem*
> Let $H$ be a $p$-dimensional subspace of $\mathbb R^n$. Any linearly independent set of exactly $p$ elements in $H$ is automatically a basis for $H$. Also, any set of $p$ elements of $H$ that spans $H$ is automatically a basis for $H$.

> *[[2.3 Characteristics of Invertible Matrices|Theorem: The Invertible Matrix Theorem]]*
> 1. $A^T$ is an invertible matrix.
> 2. $\text{Col}A = \mathbb R^n$
> 3. $\text{rank}A = n$
> 4. $\text{dim} \text{Nul}A = 0$
> 5. $\text{Nul}A = \{ \vec 0 \}$
