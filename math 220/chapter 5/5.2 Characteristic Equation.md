[[5.1 Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues|Eigenvalues]] are determined by finding values of $\lambda$ such that $A - \lambda I$ has nontrivial solutions.

If the matrix has nontrivial solutions, it must not be invertible. If it is not invertible, then it must be true that $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$. Thus, we have determined an avenue for finding eigenvalues.

> *Definition: The Characteristic Equation*
> The scalar equation $\det(A - \lambda I) = 0$ is called the **characteristic equation** of $A$.

A scalar $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ if and only if $\lambda$ satisfies the characteristic equation
$$ \det(A - \lambda I) = 0. $$

> *Definition: Similarity*
> If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices, then $A$ is **similar** to $B$ if there is an invertible matrix $P$ such that $P^{-1} AP = B$, or equivalently, $A = PBP^{-1}$. Changing $A$ into $P^{-1} AP$ is called a **similarity transformation**.

> *Theorem*
> If $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are similar, then they have the same characteristic polynomial and hence the same eigenvalues (with the same multiplicities).
