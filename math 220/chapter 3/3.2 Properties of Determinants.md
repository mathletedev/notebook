> *Theorem: [[2.1 Matrix Operations|Row Operations]] and the Determinant*
> Let $A$ be a square matrix.
> 1. If a multiple of one row of $A$ is added to another row to produce a matrix $B$, then $\det B = \det A$.
> 2. If two rows of $A$ are interchanged to produce $B$, then $\det B = -\det A$.
> 3. If one row of $A$ is multiplied by $k$ to produce $B$, then $\det B = k \det A$.

Note: We only need to reduce a matrix to an [[3.1 Introduction to Determinants|upper triangular matrix]], since we know the determinant of an UTM is the product of the values along the diagonal.

When scaling a row by $k$, we must multiply the result by $\dfrac{1}{k}$. Essentially, we are "factoring out" a $k$. E.g.

$\det B = \det \begin{bmatrix} 2 & -8 & 6 & 8 \\ 3 & -9 & 5 & 10 \\ -3 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\ 1 & -4 & 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$

1/2 R1 -> R1

$\det B = 2 \det \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -4 & 3 & 4 \\ 3 & -9 & 5 & 10 \\ -3 & 0 & 1 & -2 \\ 1 & -4 & 0 & 6 \end{bmatrix}$

Note: If there is a row of 0s, like $\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \end{bmatrix}$, then the determinant is 0.

> *Theorem*
> A square matrix $A$ is invertible if and only if $\det{A} \neq 0$.

> *Theorem*
> If $A$ is an $n \times n$ matrix, then $\det A^T = \det A$.

> *Theorem: Multiplicative Property of Determinants*
> If $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices, then $\det(AB) = (\det A)(\det B)$.

- If $\det A = k$, then $\det A^{-1} = \dfrac{1}{k}$
