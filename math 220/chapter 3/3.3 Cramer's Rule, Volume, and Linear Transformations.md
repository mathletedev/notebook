The **adjugate** of a matrix is the [[2.1 Matrix Operations#The Transpose of a Matrix|transpose]] of its cofactor matrix.

> *Theorem*
> If $A$ is a $2 \times 2$ matrix, the area of the parallelogram determined by the columns of $A$ is $|\det A|$. If $A$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix, the volume of the parallelepiped determined by the columns of $A$ is $|\det A|$.

Note: If we subtract one leg of the parallelogram from another, we end up with perpendicular sides. This does not affect the determinant, as discussed in [[3.2 Properties of Determinants]].
