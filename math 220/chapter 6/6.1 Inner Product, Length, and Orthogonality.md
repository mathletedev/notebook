> *Definition: Inner Product (Dot Product)*
> Given two vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $\mathbb R^n$, the number $\vec u^T \vec v$ is called the **inner product** of $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ and is typically written as $\vec u \cdot \vec v$.

> *Theorem: Dot Product Properties*
> Let $\vec u$, $\vec v$, and $\vec w$ be vectors in $\mathbb R^n$ and let $c$ be a scalar.
> 1. $\vec u \cdot \vec v = \vec v \cdot \vec u$
> 2. $(\vec u + \vec v) \cdot \vec w = \vec u \cdot \vec w + \vec v \cdot \vec w$
> 3. $(c \vec u) \cdot \vec v = c(\vec u \cdot \vec v) = \vec u \cdot (c \vec v)$
> 4. $\vec u \cdot \vec u \geq 0$, and $\vec u \cdot \vec u = 0$ if and only if $\vec u = \vec 0$.

> *Definition: Vector Length (Norm)*
> The **length** (or **norm**) of a vector $\vec v$ is the non-negative scalar $||\vec v||$ defined by
> $$ ||\vec v|| = \sqrt{\vec v \cdot \vec v} = \sqrt{\vec v_1^2 + \vec v_2^2 + \cdots + \vec v_n^2}, \quad \text{and} \quad ||\vec v||^2 = \vec v \cdot \vec v. $$

> *Definition: Unit Vector*
> A vector whose length is 1 is called a **unit vector**.

> *Definition: Distance Between $\vec u$ and $\vec v$*
> For $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ in $\mathbb R^n$, the distance between $\vec u$ and $\vec v$, written as $\text{dist}(\vec u, \vec v)$, is the length of the vector $\vec u - \vec v$. That is,
> $$ \text{dist}(\vec u - \vec v) = ||\vec u - \vec v||. $$

> *Theorem: The Pythagorean Theorem*
> Two vectors $\vec u$ and $\vec v$ are orthogonal if and only if $||\vec v + \vec v||^2 = ||\vec u||^2 + ||\vec v||^2$.

> *Definition: Orthogonal Complement*
> If a vector $\vec z$ is orthogonal to every vector in a subspace $W$ of $\mathbb R^n$, then $\vec z$ is said to be orthogonal to $W$.
> The set of all vectors $\vec z$ that are orthogonal to $W$ is called the **orthogonal complement** of $W$ and is denoted by $W^\perp$ (read as $W$ **perpendicular** or $W$ **perp**).

Notes:
1. A vector $\vec x$ is in $W^\perp$ if and only if $\vec x$ is orthogonal to every vector in a set that spans $W$.
2. $W^\perp$ is a subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.

> *Definition: Row Space*
> The **row space** of $A$ is defined to be the column space of $A^T$. That is to say, the row space of $A$ is the [[1.3 Vector Equations#Span|span]] of its row vectors.
