> A mistaken belief

## Gambler's fallacy
The belief that past random events influence future random events
Ex. a long run of black on a roulette wheel means red has a higher chance of appearing (it doesn't)

## Fallacy of the undistributed middle
When the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed in either the minor premise or major premise
Ex.  I have 2 eyes; all elephants have 2 eyes; therefore, I am an elephant

## Fallacy fallacy
Just because an argument contains a fallacy doesn't mean the claim is wrong
