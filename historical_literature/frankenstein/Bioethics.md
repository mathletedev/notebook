# Questions

## Prosecutor
> Do you think that what Victor did with the dead bodies was ethical?
- Cadavers are very beneficial in medicine and surgery
- Allows surgeons to practice on specific organ systems
- General consensus that they should be treated with respect
- Biggest problem is the lack of consent

> If you were to make a creation like Victor did, would you need any approval beforehand?
- At Victor's time period, probably not (no one even knows about it)

> What would be the steps to ethically making a creation like Victor did?
- Still depends on definition of what is ethical
- Again, no laws during his time against making a creation
- But, in terms of ethics, borders on the side of non-ethical
- Asexual reproduction blurs the idea of family (Victor playing God)

> In your professional opinion, do you think that Victor in any way made this monster in an ethical way?
- Victor obviously had expertise in this subject
- Kept a journal of his findings
- Can obviously have positive benefits to medicine if done correctly (replacing tissues or organs)

> Do you think that Victor was reckless or irresponsible with any of his actions?
- Didn't think
- Didn't didn't have a backup or a literal "kill-switch"
- Left immediately after seeing the monster
- Made the monster very powerful (any research currently done has been on small groups of cells or safe animals)
- Couldn't he have made a small child?

## Defendant
> Wasn’t Victor’s creation also to contribute knowledge to humanity?
- Yes; it could definitely have positive benefits on organ and tissue replacement, curing many diseases

> Victor did not have any bad intentions in his mind while making the monster. Wouldn’t his creation still be ethical?
- Whether or not Victor had good intentions when making his creation does not affect the ethics of what he did

> Everything that Victor did to create the monster was done to advance knowledge in science, including using materials of dead bodies and animals. Would that not make it ethical?
- Dead bodies, or cadavers, are commonly used by surgeons for practice
- Many dead bodies have been dissected to understand how the human body works
- Leonardo da Vinci's sketches that had great influence on medicine were results of his dissections
- Galvanism: the science of electrifying dead bodies (Luigi Galvani)
- His nephew, Giovanni Aldini, extended experiments to cows and human cadavers
- In this regard, his work was ethical

> Was digging up dead bodies even illegal during Victor’s time?
- Yes; only legal source of bodies for dissection were the gallows
- Dissected murderers and other criminals

> Frankenstein destroyed the female monster because he was thinking of humanity. Would this not be ethical on Victor’s part?
- Embryonic stem cells, could be regarded as murder
- Also thinking about humans, so could be considered ethical

### Embryonic Stem Cells
Can save lives by regrowing tissues
Unclear whether the embryo is alive
Could be regarded as murder

### Cloning
Dolly - Female Finnish Dorset sheep that was cloned from an adult somatic cell
Considered unethical as asexual reproduction blurs the idea of family
Cloning prohibited in countries after success of Dolly

### CRISPR-Cas9
Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats
Used for genome editing - "reprogramming" life
Has the possibility of treating or even curing genetic diseases such as blindness, cancer, diabetes, or HIV/AIDS

### Cadavers in Medicine
Used to train surgeons, can practice procedures on specific organ systems
Should be treated with respect - "no paring with chainsaws, no gratuitous selfies"
