### Turing Machine
Page 16
> It was a theoretical machine, an idea that existed only on paper. Devised by the brilliant British theoretical mathematician Alan Turing in 1936, this simple machine consisted of a program, a data storage device (or memory), and a step-by-step method of computation. The mechanism would pass a long thin tape of paper, like that in a ticker-tape machine, through a processing head that would read the information. This apparatus would be able to move the paper along, read a series of symbols, and produce calculations based on the input on the tape.

### Deep Blue
Page 22
> Deep Blue's strength was sheer power: It was so fast it could evaluate 200 million positions or second and look fifteen to thirty moves ahead

> Deep Blue won every game in the match. In an interview afterward, Kasparov admitted that he "sensed a new kind in intelligence" fighting against him.

### Artificial Neutral Networks
Page 32
> The branch of AI that modeled its work after the neural network if the human brain is called connectionism. It is based on the belief that the way the brain works is all about making the right connections, and those connections can just as easily be made using silicon and wire as living neurons and dendrites.

### Our Last Invention
Page 48
> Many AI theorists believe that human-level AGI (artificial general intelligence) will be humanity's final grand invention. This is because as soon as people create AGI that is as smart as a him human being, it will be able to improve itself.

### Will AI Cause Chaos in Society?
Page 49
> If millions of workers lose their jobs because of rapidly advancing AI, society could be thrown into chaos. As economist Carlota Perez, who has studied the effect of new technologies on society, explains, "A society that has established countless routines and habits, norms and regulations, to fit the conditions of the previous revolution, does not find it easy to assimilate the new one."

> Change can be both difficult and frightening, but people tend to adapt. And by looking at how technology has impacted society throughout history, it is clear that every technological revolution has created more wealth for the average person than it displaces. History has shown that automation caused a rise in literacy rates and standards of living. It also caused crime rates to fall and average life spans to lengthen.

### Is AGI Safe?
Page 50
> Goertzal is not the only person who believes that as soon as humans achieve AGI and give computers the ability to improve themselves, intelligence in artificial systems will increase at an exponential rate. But not everyone is optimistic about the outcome. Some of the world's to thinkers are extremely concerned about artificial superintelligence. Elon Musk has described it as "our biggest existential threat." Theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking warns, "The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."

> Cognitive scientist Marcus says, "My guess is in 2200 we will have AI that's reliable, trustworthy, and doesn't make stupid mistakes. Right now, we have a lot of premature AI." He points to driverless cars that cannot yet operate safely and the inability of medical chatbots to give reliable advice. "We all kinds of problems with bias, toxicity, misinformation, unreliability," he adds. "The stuff we have now isn't ready for prime time."

> While super-intelligent AI could be a force for good, such as curing cancer, Torres also painted a doomsday scenario where AIs hack government systems to start nuclear war. He wrote, "Research on artificial intelligence must slow down, it even pause. And if researchers won't make this decision, governments should make it for them."

> But Marcus says this is not a good time to stop developing AI, precisely because of it's current flaws. For example, he says driverless cars could eventually save a lot of lives on the road once the technology is perfected. "You wouldn't want to put them out on the open road now, but if you simply ban them, you're missing a big opportunity."

> It is making an immense impact on healthcare. There exist a lot of portals already active in European countries where you simply use an app that will ask you a few simple questions and give you the prescriptions.

Shows benefits of AI, can be used for healthcare

> Yes, unfortunately, artificial intelligence has also empowered cybercriminals. Taking advantage of sophisticated and intelligent technology solutions, they can find loopholes in corporate IT networks and exploit the limited security capabilities of an organization.

Cybercriminals are a problem, maybe preventable?

> The network "learns" to perform better by consuming input, passing it up through the ranks of neurons, and then comparing its final output against known results, which are then fed backwards through the system to alter how the nodes perform their computations. This reversing process is known as backpropagation and is a main feature of machine learning in general.

> So the feedforward stage of neural network processing is to take the external data into the input neurons, which apply their weights, bias, and activation function, producing the output that is passed to the hidden layer neurons that perform the same process, finally arriving at the output neurons which then do the same for the final output.

Show example of feedforward/backpropogation code

> What makes the neural network powerful is its capacity to learn based on input. This happens by using a training data set with known results, comparing the predictions against it, then using that comparison to adjust the weights and biases in the neurons.

Why is AI so powerful?

> AI-powered technologies, such as automation and machine learning, can help to improve processes and reduce the need for human labour in specific tasks. It also could improve access to education and healthcare while promoting economic growth. Virtual assistants and chatbots can provide information and support students and patients, while diagnostic tools improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

Ex. ChatGPT

> With the concern of potential job displacement due to automation, the possibility that AI could create new job opportunities is impossible to ignore. Robots can not make choices hence human intelligence and expertise are required.

Mention the use of coal & dissenters in Commercial Revolution

> The question remains: How do we know when a machine has become self-aware? And ensure its proper use, responsibly and transparently.

When will AI have a consciousness? What is consciousness?

## AI is not all killer robots. It is far more dangerous

> Victor Frankenstein played God, she says, and Mary Shelley’s manuscript still has the power to shock. In the exhibition, it is open at the page where 'by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light' Frankenstein sees for the first time 'the dull yellow eye' of the creature he has created in his laboratory.

Reference to Frankenstein

> So it is emphatically not all killer robots. Professor Martin adds, ‘AI is very useful. It’s all around us, for example your phone or your satnav or your bank are full of AI. It is changing our lives, and both as individuals and as society as a whole we need to think and act responsibly, just as we should with any other technology.
